# Introduction

## Overview

This study examines the factors influencing the likelihood of violent crimes in Toronto, focusing on two important predictors: the type of premises where the crime occurred and the time of day. Violent crime, encompassing offenses such as assault and robbery, poses significant risks to community safety and requires evidence-based strategies for prevention. Non-violent crimes, such as theft and property-related offenses, provide a contrasting baseline for analysis.

Using a detailed dataset. from the Toronto Police Service, this research aims to uncover patterns and relationships between the environment, timing, and the probability of violent crimes. By leveraging Bayesian logistic regression modeling, the study accounts for uncertainty while using prior knowledge to generate practical findings. The findings aim to inform crime prevention efforts, resource allocation, and urban safety policies by identifying high-risk contexts for violence.


## Estimand
The primary estimand of this study is the probability of a violent crime occurring given specific premises (e.g., residential, commercial, or transit) and the time of day (e.g., early morning, evening). Violent crimes include serious offenses such as assaults and robberies, while non-violent crimes encompass thefts and similar offenses. This research employs a Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate these probabilities, accounting for uncertainty and using prior knowledge.

## Results Summary

The results of this study provide clarity on the relationship between premises type, time of day, and the likelihood of a crime being violent. Premises such as "Transit" and "Outside" exhibit greater odds of violent crimes compared to the reference category ("Apartment"), reflecting their open and public nature, which may increase opportunities for conflicts. Conversely, premises like "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with a lower likelihood of violent crimes, underscoring the role of structural and social controls in reducing violence.

Time of day also plays a significant role, with "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods showing elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the baseline "Early Morning." These findings align with patterns of increased social interactions and activities during these periods. The credible interval plots further confirm the statistical significance of these predictors, emphasizing their impact on crime likelihood. Overall, the results highlight patterns that can guide focused crime prevention strategies in high-risk locations and time periods.


## Why This Study Matters

Understanding the contextual factors contributing to violent crimes can help city planners and policymakers allocate safety interventions effectively. This research focuses on premises and times of day where the likelihood of violence is highest, enabling tailored prevention strategies. The findings from this study can directly impact resource allocation for policing and urban planning, potentially reducing crime rates and enhancing public safety.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR] to process, clean, and analyze the dataset for this study. Our data is sourced from the Open Data Toronto portal [@OpenDataToronto], specifically from the "Motor Vehicle Collisions Involving Killed or Seriously Injured Persons" dataset, which captures detailed information on traffic incidents in Toronto where individuals were either killed or seriously injured. This dataset, compiled by the Toronto Police Service, includes variables that record the time, location, environmental conditions, and specific parties involved in each collision, showing factors that may increase the risk of severe outcomes.

The detailed information within the dataset enables a rigorous analysis of patterns in collision severity. By examining factors such as driver condition, road surface, and lighting conditions, we aim to identify high-risk scenarios that may require targeted safety interventions. Following principles outlined in "Telling Stories with Data" [@tellingstories], this study prioritizes transparency and reproducibility in presenting data-driven findings that can inform road safety policies.

## Measurement

The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Toronto Police Service and includes records of Major Crime Indicators (MCI) occurrences. These records capture information on five important categories of crime: Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery, and Theft Over. Unlike some crime datasets, this dataset excludes occurrences classified as "unfounded," meaning that only verified incidents are included. The definition of "unfounded," provided by Statistics Canada, is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted.”

The data collection process primarily relies on police-reported incidents. However, there are certain limitations in the completeness of the dataset. For example, some location coordinates are missing or left blank when the location could not be verified. Additionally, the dataset includes occurrences that are located outside the City of Toronto, which may slightly affect the analysis for Toronto-specific crime trends. 

Spatial data in the dataset is provided using both the old 140-neighborhood structure and the newer 158-neighborhood structure for the City of Toronto. This dual structure ensures compatibility across different time periods and administrative updates. Temporal data includes detailed timestamps that allow crimes to be categorized by time of day and season.

The unit of measurement for numerical data, such as timestamps and neighborhood IDs, is standard counts or identifiers with no inherent units. Other features, such as crime type, premises type, and time of day, are categorical variables with no associated units.

Although the data provides a robust framework for understanding crime patterns in Toronto, some aspects are modeled or incomplete. For instance, location data for certain crimes may be estimated, and the dataset does not include crimes that were not reported to the police. Despite these limitations, the dataset remains a useful resource for analyzing environmental and temporal factors influencing violent and non-violent crimes in Toronto.


## Data Cleaning

The raw crime data underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to prepare it for analysis, ensuring the dataset was both relevant and consistent for the study's objectives. Initially, only key columns were selected from the raw dataset, including EVENT_UNIQUE_ID (Unique Identifier), REPORT_DATE (Date of Report), OCC_HOUR (Hour of Occurrence), PREMISES_TYPE (Type of Premises), and OFFENCE (Offense Type). This selection ensured that only the most pertinent information was included for examining factors associated with violent crimes.

Rows with missing or irrelevant data in important columns, such as EVENT_UNIQUE_ID, PREMISES_TYPE, TIME_OF_DAY, and VIOLENT_CRIME, were removed to maintain data integrity and focus on valid observations. Offenses were categorized as either violent or non-violent to create a binary outcome variable (VIOLENT_CRIME), where offenses such as "Assault" and "Robbery" were classified as violent (1), and crimes like "Theft" or "Break and Enter" were classified as non-violent (0). Offenses that did not fit into either category were excluded from the dataset.

To analyze temporal patterns, the OCC_HOUR variable was grouped into broader time categories:

- **Early Morning**: 12 AM to 6 AM  
- **Morning**: 6 AM to 12 PM  
- **Afternoon**: 12 PM to 6 PM  
- **Evening**: 6 PM to 12 AM  

Additionally, the PREMISES_TYPE variable, which describes the type of location where the incident occurred, was trimmed to remove excess whitespace and ensure consistent formatting. This step was crucial to prevent unexpected NA values during analysis.

The cleaning process also included filtering for crimes reported during the summer month of July, aligning the dataset with the study's focus on temporal and environmental patterns in criminal activity. After grouping, formatting, and filtering the data, all rows containing NA values in important columns were dropped to ensure a clean and analyzable dataset.

Finally, the cleaned dataset was saved as a Parquet file for further analysis. This format ensures efficient storage and retrieval while preserving the structure of the data.



## Outcome variable

The primary outcome variable in this study is Violent Crime, which categorizes each incident based on whether the crime is classified as violent or non-violent. Violent crime is coded as a binary variable, where "0" represents non-violent offenses (e.g., theft, break and enter), and "1" denotes violent offenses (e.g., assault, robbery). This classification allows for an assessment of factors contributing to the likelihood of a crime being violent, providing a framework for understanding the underlying conditions associated with violent behavior.

By focusing on crimes involving violence, this outcome variable highlights important cases of interest for public safety and crime prevention efforts, as violent offenses often have severe consequences for victims and communities. This binary categorization simplifies the statistical analysis, enabling the application of logistic regression models to estimate the probability of violent crimes under varying conditions.

Analyzing violent crime in conjunction with predictor variables such as premises type and time of day helps identify the circumstances under which the risk of violence is heightened. This outcome measure serves as a crucial indicator for assessing and improving community safety policies, as it reflects the most serious consequences of criminal activity and directs attention to factors that could reduce violent incidents.

## Predictor variables

## Predictor Variables

@fig-premises-type illustrates the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes across different premises types. The results show that the highest number of crimes, both violent and non-violent, occur in "Outside" locations, followed by "Apartment" premises. Notably, violent crimes significantly outnumber non-violent ones in "Outside" locations, while "Apartments" and "Houses" have a more balanced distribution between the two crime types. Premises categorized as "Educational," "Transit," and "Other" show relatively low numbers of both violent and non-violent crimes, with "Educational" premises having the fewest incidents overall.

@fig-time-of-day highlights the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes by the time of day. The data reveals that violent crimes are most common during the "Evening," followed by "Afternoon" and "Early Morning." In contrast, non-violent crimes are more evenly distributed throughout the day but still peak during the "Evening." These findings suggest that the time of day plays a important role in influencing the likelihood of violent crimes, with evenings being a particularly high-risk period.

By examining these distributions, we gain insights into where and when violent crimes are most likely to occur. Understanding these patterns is essential for developing focused crime prevention strategies, such as increasing law enforcement presence in high-risk areas during evening hours or implementing community-based interventions in "Outside" locations.

# Model {#sec-model}

In our analysis, we utilized a Bayesian logistic regression model to examine the relationship between violent crime occurrence and two important predictors: premises type and time of day. By using this model, we aimed to understand how the location and timing of incidents influence the likelihood of a crime being classified as violent. Detailed model diagnostics and background are provided in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model Set-up

\begin{align} 
y_i|\pi_i &\sim \text{Bern}(\pi_i) \\
\text{logit}(\pi_i) &= \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{PREMISES\_TYPE}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{TIME\_OF\_DAY}_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_1 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_2 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)
\end{align}

In this model:

- \(y_i\) represents the binary outcome variable indicating whether a crime is classified as violent (\(1\) for violent crimes, \(0\) for non-violent crimes).
- \(\pi_i\) is the probability of a violent crime.
- \(\alpha\) is the intercept, representing the baseline log-odds of a violent crime when all predictors are at their reference levels.
- \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) are the coefficients associated with the predictor variables:
  - `PREMISES_TYPE`: the type of premises where the crime occurred.
  - `TIME_OF_DAY`: the time of day the crime occurred.

The logistic link function (\(\text{logit}(\pi_i)\)) models the log-odds of violent crime as a linear combination of the predictors. The priors for the intercept (\(\alpha\)) and the coefficients (\(\beta_1\), \(\beta_2\)) follow a Normal distribution with mean \(0\) and standard deviation \(2.5\). These priors regularize the model, constraining the parameters to plausible values based on prior knowledge.

This Bayesian logistic regression model was implemented using the `rstanarm` package, leveraging Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for parameter estimation. Further diagnostics and posterior summaries are discussed in the supplementary materials (see Appendix @sec-model-details).


## Model Justification

Each predictor in the model represents a specific characteristic of the crime and its context, with hypothesized effects on the likelihood of violent crime. For `PREMISES_TYPE`, it is expected that certain locations, such as "Transit" or "Outside," may have higher odds of violent crime due to increased public interactions or a lack of controlled environments. Conversely, premises like "Educational" or "House" are anticipated to have lower odds of violent crime, reflecting their relatively private or structured settings. Locations categorized as "Other" may include mixed contexts, resulting in varying effects.

For `TIME_OF_DAY`, it is hypothesized that the "Evening" period may exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, as this time is often associated with increased social activities and potential for interpersonal conflict. "Early Morning" may also show elevated odds due to decreased public surveillance and fewer witnesses. In contrast, "Morning" and "Afternoon" are expected to have lower odds, reflecting typical daytime routines with higher levels of oversight and structured activity.

By incorporating these predictors into the Bayesian logistic regression model, this study seeks to identify and quantify the relationships between crime characteristics and the likelihood of violent outcomes, providing practical findings for targeted interventions.

# Results {#sec-result}

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults. The findings align with our expectations, providing insights into how premises type and time of day influence the likelihood of violent crimes. To avoid multicollinearity, the model excludes one level from each categorical predictor as the reference group: "Apartment" for `PREMISES_TYPE` and "Early Morning" for `TIME_OF_DAY`. The intercept represents the estimated log-odds of violent crime occurring when all other predictors are held constant at their reference levels. In this case, the estimated log-odds of a violent crime occurring at an "Apartment" during "Early Morning" is 0.881.

The type of premises strongly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. For instance, crimes occurring in "Transit" premises are far more likely to be violent compared to the reference group. The estimated coefficient for `PREMISES_TYPETransit` is 2.363, indicating a substantial increase in the log-odds of violent crime in this context. On the other hand, crimes occurring in "Commercial" and "Educational" premises are less likely to be violent, with coefficients of -0.925 and -0.957, respectively. Similarly, crimes at "House" premises exhibit the lowest likelihood of violence, as reflected by a coefficient of -1.519. These results highlight that location plays a important role in determining whether a crime is violent or non-violent.

Time of day also significantly impacts the likelihood of violent crimes. Compared to the reference level of "Early Morning," the coefficients for `TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon` and `TIME_OF_DAYEvening` are 0.413 and 0.325, respectively, suggesting an elevated likelihood of violent crimes during these times. The "Morning" time of day exhibits a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, as shown by a coefficient of 0.074.

Figure 7 (see Section B.3) shows the range of coefficient estimates for our model within the 90% probability interval. However, because the credibility intervals for several predictors are relatively narrow, particularly for premises types like "Transit," it is challenging to observe the trends clearly. To address this, Figure 8 was created with the x-axis limited to a range of -5 to 5. Combining Figures 7 and 8, we observe statistical significance for several predictors, including "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," as their credibility intervals do not cross zero.

The coefficients are reported in log-odds, where a positive value indicates an increased likelihood of violent crime, and a negative value reflects a decreased likelihood. The results demonstrate clear statistical significance for important predictors such as "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," emphasizing the importance of both location and time of day in shaping violent crime outcomes.


# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Relationship between Premises Type and Violent Crime

The analysis highlights that premises type significantly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. Crimes occurring in "Transit" locations are strongly associated with higher odds of being classified as violent compared to the reference group ("Apartment"). This finding aligns with expectations, as transit environments often involve high volumes of people and limited surveillance, which may increase the potential for interpersonal conflicts. Similarly, "Outside" locations exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, likely due to their open and less controlled nature, which may facilitate confrontations or opportunistic violence. In contrast, premises such as "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with lower odds of violent crimes. These findings suggest that environments with greater structural or social control (e.g., schools, private residences) are less conducive to violent activities. These insights underscore the importance of targeted safety measures in high-risk locations, such as enhancing surveillance in transit areas or increasing community policing efforts in outdoor public spaces.

## Relationship between Time of Day and Violent Crime

Time of day also plays a important role in determining the likelihood of violent crimes. The model results indicate that "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods are associated with elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the reference period ("Early Morning"). This pattern likely reflects increased social interactions and activities during these times, which may lead to heightened opportunities for conflicts or criminal acts. In contrast, "Morning" hours exhibit a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, possibly reflecting a time of day characterized by structured routines and reduced social friction. These findings highlight the need for time-sensitive interventions, such as increased police presence during evening hours or community-based programs to address the underlying causes of violent behavior during high-risk times.

## Implications for Policy and Prevention

The results provide practical findings for crime prevention and public safety policies. For example, transit and outdoor areas, identified as high-risk premises, could benefit from increased surveillance, improved lighting, and targeted community engagement programs. Similarly, allocating law enforcement resources more strategically to focus on evening and afternoon periods could help deter violent crimes during these high-risk times. The findings also support urban planning efforts that enhance safety features in public spaces, such as the installation of security cameras and the promotion of neighborhood watch programs. By addressing the specific premises and times associated with violent crimes, policymakers can implement evidence-based strategies to reduce violence and improve community safety.

## Limitations

### Data Constraints

One limitation of this study is the exclusion of crimes that could not be definitively classified as violent or non-violent. While necessary to ensure data consistency, this filtering process may omit incidents that could provide additional context for understanding violent crime dynamics. Future research should explore ways to include these ambiguous cases to improve the comprehensiveness of the analysis.

### Focus on a Single City

The dataset is specific to crimes reported in Toronto, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other regions or cities. Crime dynamics can vary widely based on local socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. Further studies should replicate this analysis in other urban areas to assess the extent to which these findings apply across different contexts.

### Simplification of Time Categories

Grouping time into four broad categories (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) simplifies analysis but may obscure more granular patterns in violent crime occurrence. Future research could explore finer temporal granularity, such as analyzing crimes on an hourly basis, to capture additional nuances in time-of-day effects.

## Future Steps

To enhance the utility and scope of this research, future studies should consider incorporating additional predictors, such as socioeconomic factors, neighborhood characteristics, or the presence of law enforcement resources. These variables could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions contributing to violent crimes. Additionally, integrating spatial analysis with precise location data could identify specific hotspots for targeted interventions. Policymakers and city planners could leverage these insights to allocate resources more effectively, reduce violent crimes, and promote public safety in Toronto and beyond.

In @fig-post_prior, the posterior distributions of the model parameters are compared against their priors. This visual comparison highlights how the observed data influenced the posterior estimates. For instance, predictors such as `PREMISES_TYPETransit` and `TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon` show a notable shift in their posterior distributions compared to the priors, reflecting strong evidence provided by the data. Conversely, predictors with minimal shifts suggest less data-driven evidence or smaller effects on the model outcome.

## Diagnostics {#sec-diagnostics}

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo Convergence Check

To assess the convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for the Bayesian logistic regression model, trace plots and Rhat plots were analyzed. These diagnostics are crucial to ensure that the chains mix well and converge to a stable distribution, providing reliable parameter estimates.

#### Trace Plots

@fig-trace-premise and @fig-trace-time display the trace plots for the model's intercept, premises type predictors, and time of day predictors. Each plot shows the sampled parameter values across iterations for all four chains.

- **Premises Type Predictors**: As seen in @fig-trace-premise, the chains for predictors like `House`, `Commercial`, `Educational`, and `Outside` fluctuate around stable mean values, indicating good mixing and convergence.
- **Time of Day Predictors**: @fig-trace-time illustrates the trace plots for `Morning`, `Afternoon`, and `Evening` time categories, along with `Transit Premises`. The chains for these predictors also show no significant trends or drift, confirming convergence.

## 90% Credibility Interval {#sec-credibility-interval}

Figures @fig-modelresults1 and @fig-modelresults2 visualize the 90% credible intervals for the predictors in the Bayesian logistic regression model. These plots provide insights into the uncertainty surrounding the estimated coefficients for each predictor.

Figure @fig-modelresults1 displays the 90% credible intervals for all predictors without restrictions on the x-axis. This plot shows how the predictors such as `PREMISES_TYPE` and `TIME_OF_DAY` influence the likelihood of violent crimes. For example, `PREMISES_TYPETransit` has a high positive credible interval, indicating a significant increase in the likelihood of violent crime in transit areas. Conversely, `PREMISES_TYPECommercial` and `PREMISES_TYPEEducational` have negative credible intervals, indicating a lower likelihood of violent crimes in these premises types.

In Figure @fig-modelresults2, the x-axis has been restricted to a range of -5 to 5 to better visualize predictors with smaller intervals. This refined view helps highlight subtle but meaningful differences between categories like `TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon` and `TIME_OF_DAYEvening`, which show a noticeable increase in the likelihood of violent crimes compared to the reference category (`TIME_OF_DAYEarly Morning`).

# Introduction

## Overview

This study examines the factors influencing the likelihood of violent crimes in Toronto, focusing on two important predictors: the type of premises where the crime occurred and the time of day. Violent crime, encompassing offenses such as assault and robbery, poses significant risks to community safety and requires evidence-based strategies for prevention. Non-violent crimes, such as theft and property-related offenses, provide a contrasting baseline for analysis.

Using a detailed dataset. from the Toronto Police Service, this research aims to uncover patterns and relationships between the environment, timing, and the probability of violent crimes. By leveraging Bayesian logistic regression modeling, the study accounts for uncertainty while using prior knowledge to generate practical findings. The findings aim to inform crime prevention efforts, resource allocation, and urban safety policies by identifying high-risk contexts for violence.


## Estimand
The primary estimand of this study is the probability of a violent crime occurring given specific premises (e.g., residential, commercial, or transit) and the time of day (e.g., early morning, evening). Violent crimes include serious offenses such as assaults and robberies, while non-violent crimes encompass thefts and similar offenses. This research employs a Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate these probabilities, accounting for uncertainty and using prior knowledge.

## Results Summary

The results of this study provide clarity on the relationship between premises type, time of day, and the likelihood of a crime being violent. Premises such as "Transit" and "Outside" exhibit greater odds of violent crimes compared to the reference category ("Apartment"), reflecting their open and public nature, which may increase opportunities for conflicts. Conversely, premises like "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with a lower likelihood of violent crimes, underscoring the role of structural and social controls in reducing violence.

Time of day also plays a significant role, with "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods showing elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the baseline "Early Morning." These findings align with patterns of increased social interactions and activities during these periods. The credible interval plots further confirm the statistical significance of these predictors, emphasizing their impact on crime likelihood. Overall, the results highlight patterns that can guide focused crime prevention strategies in high-risk locations and time periods.


## Why This Study Matters

Understanding the contextual factors contributing to violent crimes can help city planners and policymakers allocate safety interventions effectively. This research focuses on premises and times of day where the likelihood of violence is highest, enabling tailored prevention strategies. The findings from this study can directly impact resource allocation for policing and urban planning, potentially reducing crime rates and enhancing public safety.

## Paper Structure

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In @sec-data, we present an overview of the dataset used in this study, along with a detailed description of the variables and the data cleaning process. @sec-model outlines the Bayesian logistic regression model applied in our analysis, including the model setup, assumptions, and justification. In @sec-result, we summarize the results of our analysis and interpret the findings within the context of existing literature on road safety. Finally, @sec-discussion discusses the implications of these findings, acknowledges the limitations of the study, and suggests directions for future research.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR] to process, clean, and analyze the dataset for this study. Our data is sourced from the Open Data Toronto portal [@OpenDataToronto], specifically from the "Motor Vehicle Collisions Involving Killed or Seriously Injured Persons" dataset, which captures detailed information on traffic incidents in Toronto where individuals were either killed or seriously injured. This dataset, compiled by the Toronto Police Service, includes variables that record the time, location, environmental conditions, and specific parties involved in each collision, showing factors that may increase the risk of severe outcomes.

The detailed information within the dataset enables a rigorous analysis of patterns in collision severity. By examining factors such as driver condition, road surface, and lighting conditions, we aim to identify high-risk scenarios that may require targeted safety interventions. Following principles outlined in "Telling Stories with Data" [@tellingstories], this study prioritizes transparency and reproducibility in presenting data-driven findings that can inform road safety policies.

## Measurement

The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Toronto Police Service and includes records of Major Crime Indicators (MCI) occurrences. These records capture information on five important categories of crime: Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery, and Theft Over. Unlike some crime datasets, this dataset excludes occurrences classified as "unfounded," meaning that only verified incidents are included. The definition of "unfounded," provided by Statistics Canada, is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted.”

The data collection process primarily relies on police-reported incidents. However, there are certain limitations in the completeness of the dataset. For example, some location coordinates are missing or left blank when the location could not be verified. Additionally, the dataset includes occurrences that are located outside the City of Toronto, which may slightly affect the analysis for Toronto-specific crime trends. 

Spatial data in the dataset is provided using both the old 140-neighborhood structure and the newer 158-neighborhood structure for the City of Toronto. This dual structure ensures compatibility across different time periods and administrative updates. Temporal data includes detailed timestamps that allow crimes to be categorized by time of day and season.

The unit of measurement for numerical data, such as timestamps and neighborhood IDs, is standard counts or identifiers with no inherent units. Other features, such as crime type, premises type, and time of day, are categorical variables with no associated units.

Although the data provides a robust framework for understanding crime patterns in Toronto, some aspects are modeled or incomplete. For instance, location data for certain crimes may be estimated, and the dataset does not include crimes that were not reported to the police. Despite these limitations, the dataset remains a useful resource for analyzing environmental and temporal factors influencing violent and non-violent crimes in Toronto.


## Data Cleaning

The raw crime data underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to prepare it for analysis, ensuring the dataset was both relevant and consistent for the study's objectives. Initially, only key columns were selected from the raw dataset, including EVENT_UNIQUE_ID (Unique Identifier), REPORT_DATE (Date of Report), OCC_HOUR (Hour of Occurrence), PREMISES_TYPE (Type of Premises), and OFFENCE (Offense Type). This selection ensured that only the most pertinent information was included for examining factors associated with violent crimes.

Rows with missing or irrelevant data in important columns, such as EVENT_UNIQUE_ID, PREMISES_TYPE, TIME_OF_DAY, and VIOLENT_CRIME, were removed to maintain data integrity and focus on valid observations. Offenses were categorized as either violent or non-violent to create a binary outcome variable (VIOLENT_CRIME), where offenses such as "Assault" and "Robbery" were classified as violent (1), and crimes like "Theft" or "Break and Enter" were classified as non-violent (0). Offenses that did not fit into either category were excluded from the dataset.

To analyze temporal patterns, the OCC_HOUR variable was grouped into broader time categories:

- **Early Morning**: 12 AM to 6 AM  
- **Morning**: 6 AM to 12 PM  
- **Afternoon**: 12 PM to 6 PM  
- **Evening**: 6 PM to 12 AM  

Additionally, the PREMISES_TYPE variable, which describes the type of location where the incident occurred, was trimmed to remove excess whitespace and ensure consistent formatting. This step was crucial to prevent unexpected NA values during analysis.

The cleaning process also included filtering for crimes reported during the summer month of July, aligning the dataset with the study's focus on temporal and environmental patterns in criminal activity. After grouping, formatting, and filtering the data, all rows containing NA values in important columns were dropped to ensure a clean and analyzable dataset.

Finally, the cleaned dataset was saved as a Parquet file for further analysis. This format ensures efficient storage and retrieval while preserving the structure of the data.



## Outcome variable

The primary outcome variable in this study is Violent Crime, which categorizes each incident based on whether the crime is classified as violent or non-violent. Violent crime is coded as a binary variable, where "0" represents non-violent offenses (e.g., theft, break and enter), and "1" denotes violent offenses (e.g., assault, robbery). This classification allows for an assessment of factors contributing to the likelihood of a crime being violent, providing a framework for understanding the underlying conditions associated with violent behavior.

By focusing on crimes involving violence, this outcome variable highlights important cases of interest for public safety and crime prevention efforts, as violent offenses often have severe consequences for victims and communities. This binary categorization simplifies the statistical analysis, enabling the application of logistic regression models to estimate the probability of violent crimes under varying conditions.

Analyzing violent crime in conjunction with predictor variables such as premises type and time of day helps identify the circumstances under which the risk of violence is heightened. This outcome measure serves as a crucial indicator for assessing and improving community safety policies, as it reflects the most serious consequences of criminal activity and directs attention to factors that could reduce violent incidents.

## Predictor variables

## Predictor Variables

@fig-premises-type illustrates the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes across different premises types. The results show that the highest number of crimes, both violent and non-violent, occur in "Outside" locations, followed by "Apartment" premises. Notably, violent crimes significantly outnumber non-violent ones in "Outside" locations, while "Apartments" and "Houses" have a more balanced distribution between the two crime types. Premises categorized as "Educational," "Transit," and "Other" show relatively low numbers of both violent and non-violent crimes, with "Educational" premises having the fewest incidents overall.

@fig-time-of-day highlights the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes by the time of day. The data reveals that violent crimes are most common during the "Evening," followed by "Afternoon" and "Early Morning." In contrast, non-violent crimes are more evenly distributed throughout the day but still peak during the "Evening." These findings suggest that the time of day plays a important role in influencing the likelihood of violent crimes, with evenings being a particularly high-risk period.

By examining these distributions, we gain insights into where and when violent crimes are most likely to occur. Understanding these patterns is essential for developing focused crime prevention strategies, such as increasing law enforcement presence in high-risk areas during evening hours or implementing community-based interventions in "Outside" locations.

# Model {#sec-model}

In our analysis, we utilized a Bayesian logistic regression model to examine the relationship between violent crime occurrence and two important predictors: premises type and time of day. By using this model, we aimed to understand how the location and timing of incidents influence the likelihood of a crime being classified as violent. Detailed model diagnostics and background are provided in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model Set-up

\begin{align} 
y_i|\pi_i &\sim \text{Bern}(\pi_i) \\
\text{logit}(\pi_i) &= \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{PREMISES\_TYPE}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{TIME\_OF\_DAY}_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_1 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_2 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)
\end{align}

In this model:

- \(y_i\) represents the binary outcome variable indicating whether a crime is classified as violent (\(1\) for violent crimes, \(0\) for non-violent crimes).
- \(\pi_i\) is the probability of a violent crime.
- \(\alpha\) is the intercept, representing the baseline log-odds of a violent crime when all predictors are at their reference levels.
- \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) are the coefficients associated with the predictor variables:
  - `PREMISES_TYPE`: the type of premises where the crime occurred.
  - `TIME_OF_DAY`: the time of day the crime occurred.

The logistic link function (\(\text{logit}(\pi_i)\)) models the log-odds of violent crime as a linear combination of the predictors. The priors for the intercept (\(\alpha\)) and the coefficients (\(\beta_1\), \(\beta_2\)) follow a Normal distribution with mean \(0\) and standard deviation \(2.5\). These priors regularize the model, constraining the parameters to plausible values based on prior knowledge.

This Bayesian logistic regression model was implemented using the `rstanarm` package, leveraging Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for parameter estimation. Further diagnostics and posterior summaries are discussed in the supplementary materials (see Appendix @sec-model-details).


## Model Justification

Each predictor in the model represents a specific characteristic of the crime and its context, with hypothesized effects on the likelihood of violent crime. For `PREMISES_TYPE`, it is expected that certain locations, such as "Transit" or "Outside," may have higher odds of violent crime due to increased public interactions or a lack of controlled environments. Conversely, premises like "Educational" or "House" are anticipated to have lower odds of violent crime, reflecting their relatively private or structured settings. Locations categorized as "Other" may include mixed contexts, resulting in varying effects.

For `TIME_OF_DAY`, it is hypothesized that the "Evening" period may exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, as this time is often associated with increased social activities and potential for interpersonal conflict. "Early Morning" may also show elevated odds due to decreased public surveillance and fewer witnesses. In contrast, "Morning" and "Afternoon" are expected to have lower odds, reflecting typical daytime routines with higher levels of oversight and structured activity.

By incorporating these predictors into the Bayesian logistic regression model, this study seeks to identify and quantify the relationships between crime characteristics and the likelihood of violent outcomes, providing practical findings for targeted interventions.

# Results {#sec-result}

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults. The findings align with our expectations, providing insights into how premises type and time of day influence the likelihood of violent crimes. To avoid multicollinearity, the model excludes one level from each categorical predictor as the reference group: "Apartment" for `PREMISES_TYPE` and "Early Morning" for `TIME_OF_DAY`. The intercept represents the estimated log-odds of violent crime occurring when all other predictors are held constant at their reference levels. In this case, the estimated log-odds of a violent crime occurring at an "Apartment" during "Early Morning" is 0.881.

The type of premises strongly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. For instance, crimes occurring in "Transit" premises are far more likely to be violent compared to the reference group. The estimated coefficient for `PREMISES_TYPETransit` is 2.363, indicating a substantial increase in the log-odds of violent crime in this context. On the other hand, crimes occurring in "Commercial" and "Educational" premises are less likely to be violent, with coefficients of -0.925 and -0.957, respectively. Similarly, crimes at "House" premises exhibit the lowest likelihood of violence, as reflected by a coefficient of -1.519. These results highlight that location plays a important role in determining whether a crime is violent or non-violent.

Time of day also significantly impacts the likelihood of violent crimes. Compared to the reference level of "Early Morning," the coefficients for `TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon` and `TIME_OF_DAYEvening` are 0.413 and 0.325, respectively, suggesting an elevated likelihood of violent crimes during these times. The "Morning" time of day exhibits a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, as shown by a coefficient of 0.074.

Figure 7 (see Section B.3) shows the range of coefficient estimates for our model within the 90% probability interval. However, because the credibility intervals for several predictors are relatively narrow, particularly for premises types like "Transit," it is challenging to observe the trends clearly. To address this, Figure 8 was created with the x-axis limited to a range of -5 to 5. Combining Figures 7 and 8, we observe statistical significance for several predictors, including "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," as their credibility intervals do not cross zero.

The coefficients are reported in log-odds, where a positive value indicates an increased likelihood of violent crime, and a negative value reflects a decreased likelihood. The results demonstrate clear statistical significance for important predictors such as "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," emphasizing the importance of both location and time of day in shaping violent crime outcomes.


# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Relationship between Premises Type and Violent Crime

The analysis highlights that premises type significantly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. Crimes occurring in "Transit" locations are strongly associated with higher odds of being classified as violent compared to the reference group ("Apartment"). This finding aligns with expectations, as transit environments often involve high volumes of people and limited surveillance, which may increase the potential for interpersonal conflicts. Similarly, "Outside" locations exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, likely due to their open and less controlled nature, which may facilitate confrontations or opportunistic violence. In contrast, premises such as "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with lower odds of violent crimes. These findings suggest that environments with greater structural or social control (e.g., schools, private residences) are less conducive to violent activities. These insights underscore the importance of targeted safety measures in high-risk locations, such as enhancing surveillance in transit areas or increasing community policing efforts in outdoor public spaces.

## Relationship between Time of Day and Violent Crime

Time of day also plays a important role in determining the likelihood of violent crimes. The model results indicate that "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods are associated with elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the reference period ("Early Morning"). This pattern likely reflects increased social interactions and activities during these times, which may lead to heightened opportunities for conflicts or criminal acts. In contrast, "Morning" hours exhibit a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, possibly reflecting a time of day characterized by structured routines and reduced social friction. These findings highlight the need for time-sensitive interventions, such as increased police presence during evening hours or community-based programs to address the underlying causes of violent behavior during high-risk times.

## Implications for Policy and Prevention

The results provide practical findings for crime prevention and public safety policies. For example, transit and outdoor areas, identified as high-risk premises, could benefit from increased surveillance, improved lighting, and targeted community engagement programs. Similarly, allocating law enforcement resources more strategically to focus on evening and afternoon periods could help deter violent crimes during these high-risk times. The findings also support urban planning efforts that enhance safety features in public spaces, such as the installation of security cameras and the promotion of neighborhood watch programs. By addressing the specific premises and times associated with violent crimes, policymakers can implement evidence-based strategies to reduce violence and improve community safety.

## Limitations

### Data Constraints

One limitation of this study is the exclusion of crimes that could not be definitively classified as violent or non-violent. While necessary to ensure data consistency, this filtering process may omit incidents that could provide additional context for understanding violent crime dynamics. Future research should explore ways to include these ambiguous cases to improve the comprehensiveness of the analysis.

### Focus on a Single City

The dataset is specific to crimes reported in Toronto, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other regions or cities. Crime dynamics can vary widely based on local socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. Further studies should replicate this analysis in other urban areas to assess the extent to which these findings apply across different contexts.

### Simplification of Time Categories

Grouping time into four broad categories (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) simplifies analysis but may obscure more granular patterns in violent crime occurrence. Future research could explore finer temporal granularity, such as analyzing crimes on an hourly basis, to capture additional nuances in time-of-day effects.

## Future Steps

To enhance the utility and scope of this research, future studies should consider incorporating additional predictors, such as socioeconomic factors, neighborhood characteristics, or the presence of law enforcement resources. These variables could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions contributing to violent crimes. Additionally, integrating spatial analysis with precise location data could identify specific hotspots for targeted interventions. Policymakers and city planners could leverage these insights to allocate resources more effectively, reduce violent crimes, and promote public safety in Toronto and beyond.

# Additional data details

# Model details {#sec-model-details}

## Posterior Predictive Check and Prior-Posterior Comparison

The posterior predictive check in @fig-post_dist provides an evaluation of how well the Bayesian logistic regression model replicates the observed data. The posterior distribution (\(y_{\text{rep}}\)) closely aligns with the observed data (\(y\)), indicating that the model provides a good fit and captures the essential patterns in the data.

In @fig-post_prior, the posterior distributions of the model parameters are compared against their priors. This visual comparison highlights how the observed data influenced the posterior estimates. For instance, predictors such as `PREMISES_TYPETransit` and `TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon` show a notable shift in their posterior distributions compared to the priors, reflecting strong evidence provided by the data. Conversely, predictors with minimal shifts suggest less data-driven evidence or smaller effects on the model outcome.

## Diagnostics {#sec-diagnostics}

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo Convergence Check

To assess the convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for the Bayesian logistic regression model, trace plots and Rhat plots were analyzed. These diagnostics are crucial to ensure that the chains mix well and converge to a stable distribution, providing reliable parameter estimates.

#### Trace Plots

@fig-trace-premise and @fig-trace-time display the trace plots for the model's intercept, premises type predictors, and time of day predictors. Each plot shows the sampled parameter values across iterations for all four chains.

- **Premises Type Predictors**: As seen in @fig-trace-premise, the chains for predictors like `House`, `Commercial`, `Educational`, and `Outside` fluctuate around stable mean values, indicating good mixing and convergence.
- **Time of Day Predictors**: @fig-trace-time illustrates the trace plots for `Morning`, `Afternoon`, and `Evening` time categories, along with `Transit Premises`. The chains for these predictors also show no significant trends or drift, confirming convergence.

## 90% Credibility Interval {#sec-credibility-interval}

Figures @fig-modelresults1 and @fig-modelresults2 visualize the 90% credible intervals for the predictors in the Bayesian logistic regression model. These plots provide insights into the uncertainty surrounding the estimated coefficients for each predictor.

Figure @fig-modelresults1 displays the 90% credible intervals for all predictors without restrictions on the x-axis. This plot shows how the predictors such as `PREMISES_TYPE` and `TIME_OF_DAY` influence the likelihood of violent crimes. For example, `PREMISES_TYPETransit` has a high positive credible interval, indicating a significant increase in the likelihood of violent crime in transit areas. Conversely, `PREMISES_TYPECommercial` and `PREMISES_TYPEEducational` have negative credible intervals, indicating a lower likelihood of violent crimes in these premises types.

In Figure @fig-modelresults2, the x-axis has been restricted to a range of -5 to 5 to better visualize predictors with smaller intervals. This refined view helps highlight subtle but meaningful differences between categories like `TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon` and `TIME_OF_DAYEvening`, which show a noticeable increase in the likelihood of violent crimes compared to the reference category (`TIME_OF_DAYEarly Morning`).

# Introduction

## Overview

This study examines the factors influencing the likelihood of violent crimes in Toronto, focusing on two important predictors: the type of premises where the crime occurred and the time of day. Violent crime, encompassing offenses such as assault and robbery, poses significant risks to community safety and requires evidence-based strategies for prevention. Non-violent crimes, such as theft and property-related offenses, provide a contrasting baseline for analysis.

Using a detailed dataset. from the Toronto Police Service, this research aims to uncover patterns and relationships between the environment, timing, and the probability of violent crimes. By leveraging Bayesian logistic regression modeling, the study accounts for uncertainty while using prior knowledge to generate practical findings. The findings aim to inform crime prevention efforts, resource allocation, and urban safety policies by identifying high-risk contexts for violence.


## Estimand
The primary estimand of this study is the probability of a violent crime occurring given specific premises (e.g., residential, commercial, or transit) and the time of day (e.g., early morning, evening). Violent crimes include serious offenses such as assaults and robberies, while non-violent crimes encompass thefts and similar offenses. This research employs a Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate these probabilities, accounting for uncertainty and using prior knowledge.

## Results Summary

The results of this study provide clarity on the relationship between premises type, time of day, and the likelihood of a crime being violent. Premises such as "Transit" and "Outside" exhibit greater odds of violent crimes compared to the reference category ("Apartment"), reflecting their open and public nature, which may increase opportunities for conflicts. Conversely, premises like "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with a lower likelihood of violent crimes, underscoring the role of structural and social controls in reducing violence.

Time of day also plays a significant role, with "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods showing elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the baseline "Early Morning." These findings align with patterns of increased social interactions and activities during these periods. The credible interval plots further confirm the statistical significance of these predictors, emphasizing their impact on crime likelihood. Overall, the results highlight patterns that can guide focused crime prevention strategies in high-risk locations and time periods.


## Why This Study Matters

Understanding the contextual factors contributing to violent crimes can help city planners and policymakers allocate safety interventions effectively. This research focuses on premises and times of day where the likelihood of violence is highest, enabling tailored prevention strategies. The findings from this study can directly impact resource allocation for policing and urban planning, potentially reducing crime rates and enhancing public safety.

## Paper Structure

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In @sec-data, we present an overview of the dataset used in this study, along with a detailed description of the variables and the data cleaning process. @sec-model outlines the Bayesian logistic regression model applied in our analysis, including the model setup, assumptions, and justification. In @sec-result, we summarize the results of our analysis and interpret the findings within the context of existing literature on road safety. Finally, @sec-discussion discusses the implications of these findings, acknowledges the limitations of the study, and suggests directions for future research.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR] to process, clean, and analyze the dataset for this study. Our data is sourced from the Open Data Toronto portal [@OpenDataToronto], specifically from the "Motor Vehicle Collisions Involving Killed or Seriously Injured Persons" dataset, which captures detailed information on traffic incidents in Toronto where individuals were either killed or seriously injured. This dataset, compiled by the Toronto Police Service, includes variables that record the time, location, environmental conditions, and specific parties involved in each collision, showing factors that may increase the risk of severe outcomes.

The detailed information within the dataset enables a rigorous analysis of patterns in collision severity. By examining factors such as driver condition, road surface, and lighting conditions, we aim to identify high-risk scenarios that may require targeted safety interventions. Following principles outlined in "Telling Stories with Data" [@tellingstories], this study prioritizes transparency and reproducibility in presenting data-driven findings that can inform road safety policies.

## Measurement

The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Toronto Police Service and includes records of Major Crime Indicators (MCI) occurrences. These records capture information on five important categories of crime: Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery, and Theft Over. Unlike some crime datasets, this dataset excludes occurrences classified as "unfounded," meaning that only verified incidents are included. The definition of "unfounded," provided by Statistics Canada, is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted.”

The data collection process primarily relies on police-reported incidents. However, there are certain limitations in the completeness of the dataset. For example, some location coordinates are missing or left blank when the location could not be verified. Additionally, the dataset includes occurrences that are located outside the City of Toronto, which may slightly affect the analysis for Toronto-specific crime trends. 

Spatial data in the dataset is provided using both the old 140-neighborhood structure and the newer 158-neighborhood structure for the City of Toronto. This dual structure ensures compatibility across different time periods and administrative updates. Temporal data includes detailed timestamps that allow crimes to be categorized by time of day and season.

The unit of measurement for numerical data, such as timestamps and neighborhood IDs, is standard counts or identifiers with no inherent units. Other features, such as crime type, premises type, and time of day, are categorical variables with no associated units.

Although the data provides a robust framework for understanding crime patterns in Toronto, some aspects are modeled or incomplete. For instance, location data for certain crimes may be estimated, and the dataset does not include crimes that were not reported to the police. Despite these limitations, the dataset remains a useful resource for analyzing environmental and temporal factors influencing violent and non-violent crimes in Toronto.


## Data Cleaning

The raw crime data underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to prepare it for analysis, ensuring the dataset was both relevant and consistent for the study's objectives. Initially, only key columns were selected from the raw dataset, including EVENT_UNIQUE_ID (Unique Identifier), REPORT_DATE (Date of Report), OCC_HOUR (Hour of Occurrence), PREMISES_TYPE (Type of Premises), and OFFENCE (Offense Type). This selection ensured that only the most pertinent information was included for examining factors associated with violent crimes.

Rows with missing or irrelevant data in important columns, such as EVENT_UNIQUE_ID, PREMISES_TYPE, TIME_OF_DAY, and VIOLENT_CRIME, were removed to maintain data integrity and focus on valid observations. Offenses were categorized as either violent or non-violent to create a binary outcome variable (VIOLENT_CRIME), where offenses such as "Assault" and "Robbery" were classified as violent (1), and crimes like "Theft" or "Break and Enter" were classified as non-violent (0). Offenses that did not fit into either category were excluded from the dataset.

To analyze temporal patterns, the OCC_HOUR variable was grouped into broader time categories:

- **Early Morning**: 12 AM to 6 AM  
- **Morning**: 6 AM to 12 PM  
- **Afternoon**: 12 PM to 6 PM  
- **Evening**: 6 PM to 12 AM  

Additionally, the PREMISES_TYPE variable, which describes the type of location where the incident occurred, was trimmed to remove excess whitespace and ensure consistent formatting. This step was crucial to prevent unexpected NA values during analysis.

The cleaning process also included filtering for crimes reported during the summer month of July, aligning the dataset with the study's focus on temporal and environmental patterns in criminal activity. After grouping, formatting, and filtering the data, all rows containing NA values in important columns were dropped to ensure a clean and analyzable dataset.

Finally, the cleaned dataset was saved as a Parquet file for further analysis. This format ensures efficient storage and retrieval while preserving the structure of the data.



## Outcome variable

The primary outcome variable in this study is Violent Crime, which categorizes each incident based on whether the crime is classified as violent or non-violent. Violent crime is coded as a binary variable, where "0" represents non-violent offenses (e.g., theft, break and enter), and "1" denotes violent offenses (e.g., assault, robbery). This classification allows for an assessment of factors contributing to the likelihood of a crime being violent, providing a framework for understanding the underlying conditions associated with violent behavior.

By focusing on crimes involving violence, this outcome variable highlights important cases of interest for public safety and crime prevention efforts, as violent offenses often have severe consequences for victims and communities. This binary categorization simplifies the statistical analysis, enabling the application of logistic regression models to estimate the probability of violent crimes under varying conditions.

Analyzing violent crime in conjunction with predictor variables such as premises type and time of day helps identify the circumstances under which the risk of violence is heightened. This outcome measure serves as a crucial indicator for assessing and improving community safety policies, as it reflects the most serious consequences of criminal activity and directs attention to factors that could reduce violent incidents.

## Predictor variables

@fig-premises-type illustrates the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes across different premises types. The results show that the highest number of crimes, both violent and non-violent, occur in "Outside" locations, followed by "Apartment" premises. Notably, violent crimes significantly outnumber non-violent ones in "Outside" locations, while "Apartments" and "Houses" have a more balanced distribution between the two crime types. Premises categorized as "Educational," "Transit," and "Other" show relatively low numbers of both violent and non-violent crimes, with "Educational" premises having the fewest incidents overall.

@fig-time-of-day highlights the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes by the time of day. The data reveals that violent crimes are most common during the "Evening," followed by "Afternoon" and "Early Morning." In contrast, non-violent crimes are more evenly distributed throughout the day but still peak during the "Evening." These findings suggest that the time of day plays a important role in influencing the likelihood of violent crimes, with evenings being a particularly high-risk period.

By examining these distributions, we gain insights into where and when violent crimes are most likely to occur. Understanding these patterns is essential for developing focused crime prevention strategies, such as increasing law enforcement presence in high-risk areas during evening hours or implementing community-based interventions in "Outside" locations.

# Model {#sec-model}

In our analysis, we utilized a Bayesian logistic regression model to examine the relationship between violent crime occurrence and two important predictors: premises type and time of day. By using this model, we aimed to understand how the location and timing of incidents influence the likelihood of a crime being classified as violent. Detailed model diagnostics and background are provided in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model Set-up

\begin{align} 
y_i|\pi_i &\sim \text{Bern}(\pi_i) \\
\text{logit}(\pi_i) &= \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{PREMISES\_TYPE}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{TIME\_OF\_DAY}_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_1 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_2 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)
\end{align}

In this model:

- \(y_i\) represents the binary outcome variable indicating whether a crime is classified as violent (\(1\) for violent crimes, \(0\) for non-violent crimes).
- \(\pi_i\) is the probability of a violent crime.
- \(\alpha\) is the intercept, representing the baseline log-odds of a violent crime when all predictors are at their reference levels.
- \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) are the coefficients associated with the predictor variables:
  - PREMISES_TYPE: the type of premises where the crime occurred.
  - TIME_OF_DAY: the time of day the crime occurred.

The logistic link function (\(\text{logit}(\pi_i)\)) models the log-odds of violent crime as a linear combination of the predictors. The priors for the intercept (\(\alpha\)) and the coefficients (\(\beta_1\), \(\beta_2\)) follow a Normal distribution with mean \(0\) and standard deviation \(2.5\). These priors regularize the model, constraining the parameters to plausible values based on prior knowledge.

This Bayesian logistic regression model was implemented using the rstanarm package, leveraging Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for parameter estimation. Further diagnostics and posterior summaries are discussed in the supplementary materials (see Appendix @sec-model-details).


## Model Justification

Each predictor in the model represents a specific characteristic of the crime and its context, with hypothesized effects on the likelihood of violent crime. For PREMISES_TYPE, it is expected that certain locations, such as "Transit" or "Outside," may have higher odds of violent crime due to increased public interactions or a lack of controlled environments. Conversely, premises like "Educational" or "House" are anticipated to have lower odds of violent crime, reflecting their relatively private or structured settings. Locations categorized as "Other" may include mixed contexts, resulting in varying effects.

For TIME_OF_DAY, it is hypothesized that the "Evening" period may exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, as this time is often associated with increased social activities and potential for interpersonal conflict. "Early Morning" may also show elevated odds due to decreased public surveillance and fewer witnesses. In contrast, "Morning" and "Afternoon" are expected to have lower odds, reflecting typical daytime routines with higher levels of oversight and structured activity.

By incorporating these predictors into the Bayesian logistic regression model, this study seeks to identify and quantify the relationships between crime characteristics and the likelihood of violent outcomes, providing practical findings for targeted interventions.

  ),

  )


# Results {#sec-result}

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults. The findings align with our expectations, providing insights into how premises type and time of day influence the likelihood of violent crimes. To avoid multicollinearity, the model excludes one level from each categorical predictor as the reference group: "Apartment" for PREMISES_TYPE and "Early Morning" for TIME_OF_DAY. The intercept represents the estimated log-odds of violent crime occurring when all other predictors are held constant at their reference levels. In this case, the estimated log-odds of a violent crime occurring at an "Apartment" during "Early Morning" is 0.881.

The type of premises strongly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. For instance, crimes occurring in "Transit" premises are far more likely to be violent compared to the reference group. The estimated coefficient for PREMISES_TYPETransit is 2.363, indicating a substantial increase in the log-odds of violent crime in this context. On the other hand, crimes occurring in "Commercial" and "Educational" premises are less likely to be violent, with coefficients of -0.925 and -0.957, respectively. Similarly, crimes at "House" premises exhibit the lowest likelihood of violence, as reflected by a coefficient of -1.519. These results highlight that location plays a important role in determining whether a crime is violent or non-violent.

Time of day also significantly impacts the likelihood of violent crimes. Compared to the reference level of "Early Morning," the coefficients for TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon and TIME_OF_DAYEvening are 0.413 and 0.325, respectively, suggesting an elevated likelihood of violent crimes during these times. The "Morning" time of day exhibits a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, as shown by a coefficient of 0.074.

Figure 7 (see Section B.3) shows the range of coefficient estimates for our model within the 90% probability interval. However, because the credibility intervals for several predictors are relatively narrow, particularly for premises types like "Transit," it is challenging to observe the trends clearly. To address this, Figure 8 was created with the x-axis limited to a range of -5 to 5. Combining Figures 7 and 8, we observe statistical significance for several predictors, including "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," as their credibility intervals do not cross zero.

The coefficients are reported in log-odds, where a positive value indicates an increased likelihood of violent crime, and a negative value reflects a decreased likelihood. The results demonstrate clear statistical significance for important predictors such as "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," emphasizing the importance of both location and time of day in shaping violent crime outcomes.


# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Relationship between Premises Type and Violent Crime

The analysis highlights that premises type significantly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. Crimes occurring in "Transit" locations are strongly associated with higher odds of being classified as violent compared to the reference group ("Apartment"). This finding aligns with expectations, as transit environments often involve high volumes of people and limited surveillance, which may increase the potential for interpersonal conflicts. Similarly, "Outside" locations exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, likely due to their open and less controlled nature, which may facilitate confrontations or opportunistic violence. In contrast, premises such as "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with lower odds of violent crimes. These findings suggest that environments with greater structural or social control (e.g., schools, private residences) are less conducive to violent activities. These insights underscore the importance of targeted safety measures in high-risk locations, such as enhancing surveillance in transit areas or increasing community policing efforts in outdoor public spaces.

## Relationship between Time of Day and Violent Crime

Time of day also plays a important role in determining the likelihood of violent crimes. The model results indicate that "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods are associated with elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the reference period ("Early Morning"). This pattern likely reflects increased social interactions and activities during these times, which may lead to heightened opportunities for conflicts or criminal acts. In contrast, "Morning" hours exhibit a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, possibly reflecting a time of day characterized by structured routines and reduced social friction. These findings highlight the need for time-sensitive interventions, such as increased police presence during evening hours or community-based programs to address the underlying causes of violent behavior during high-risk times.

## Implications for Policy and Prevention

The results provide practical findings for crime prevention and public safety policies. For example, transit and outdoor areas, identified as high-risk premises, could benefit from increased surveillance, improved lighting, and targeted community engagement programs. Similarly, allocating law enforcement resources more strategically to focus on evening and afternoon periods could help deter violent crimes during these high-risk times. The findings also support urban planning efforts that enhance safety features in public spaces, such as the installation of security cameras and the promotion of neighborhood watch programs. By addressing the specific premises and times associated with violent crimes, policymakers can implement evidence-based strategies to reduce violence and improve community safety.

## Limitations

### Data Constraints

One limitation of this study is the exclusion of crimes that could not be definitively classified as violent or non-violent. While necessary to ensure data consistency, this filtering process may omit incidents that could provide additional context for understanding violent crime dynamics. Future research should explore ways to include these ambiguous cases to improve the comprehensiveness of the analysis.

### Focus on a Single City

The dataset is specific to crimes reported in Toronto, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other regions or cities. Crime dynamics can vary widely based on local socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. Further studies should replicate this analysis in other urban areas to assess the extent to which these findings apply across different contexts.

### Simplification of Time Categories

Grouping time into four broad categories (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) simplifies analysis but may obscure more granular patterns in violent crime occurrence. Future research could explore finer temporal granularity, such as analyzing crimes on an hourly basis, to capture additional nuances in time-of-day effects.

## Future Steps

To enhance the utility and scope of this research, future studies should consider incorporating additional predictors, such as socioeconomic factors, neighborhood characteristics, or the presence of law enforcement resources. These variables could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions contributing to violent crimes. Additionally, integrating spatial analysis with precise location data could identify specific hotspots for targeted interventions. Policymakers and city planners could leverage these insights to allocate resources more effectively, reduce violent crimes, and promote public safety in Toronto and beyond.

# Model details {#sec-model-details}

## Posterior Predictive Check and Prior-Posterior Comparison

The posterior predictive check in @fig-post_dist provides an evaluation of how well the Bayesian logistic regression model replicates the observed data. The posterior distribution (\(y_{\text{rep}}\)) closely aligns with the observed data (\(y\)), indicating that the model provides a good fit and captures the essential patterns in the data.

In @fig-post_prior, the posterior distributions of the model parameters are compared against their priors. This visual comparison highlights how the observed data influenced the posterior estimates. For instance, predictors such as PREMISES_TYPETransit and TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon show a notable shift in their posterior distributions compared to the priors, reflecting strong evidence provided by the data. Conversely, predictors with minimal shifts suggest less data-driven evidence or smaller effects on the model outcome.

## Diagnostics {#sec-diagnostics}

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo Convergence Check

To assess the convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for the Bayesian logistic regression model, trace plots and Rhat plots were analyzed. These diagnostics are crucial to ensure that the chains mix well and converge to a stable distribution, providing reliable parameter estimates.

#### Trace Plots

@fig-trace-premise and @fig-trace-time display the trace plots for the model's intercept, premises type predictors, and time of day predictors. Each plot shows the sampled parameter values across iterations for all four chains.

- **Premises Type Predictors**: As seen in @fig-trace-premise, the chains for predictors like House, Commercial, Educational, and Outside fluctuate around stable mean values, indicating good mixing and convergence.
- **Time of Day Predictors**: @fig-trace-time illustrates the trace plots for Morning, Afternoon, and Evening time categories, along with Transit Premises. The chains for these predictors also show no significant trends or drift, confirming convergence.

## 90% Credibility Interval {#sec-credibility-interval}

Figures @fig-modelresults1 and @fig-modelresults2 visualize the 90% credible intervals for the predictors in the Bayesian logistic regression model. These plots provide insights into the uncertainty surrounding the estimated coefficients for each predictor.

Figure @fig-modelresults1 displays the 90% credible intervals for all predictors without restrictions on the x-axis. This plot shows how the predictors such as PREMISES_TYPE and TIME_OF_DAY influence the likelihood of violent crimes. For example, PREMISES_TYPETransit has a high positive credible interval, indicating a significant increase in the likelihood of violent crime in transit areas. Conversely, PREMISES_TYPECommercial and PREMISES_TYPEEducational have negative credible intervals, indicating a lower likelihood of violent crimes in these premises types.

In Figure @fig-modelresults2, the x-axis has been restricted to a range of -5 to 5 to better visualize predictors with smaller intervals. This refined view helps highlight subtle but meaningful differences between categories like TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon and TIME_OF_DAYEvening, which show a noticeable increase in the likelihood of violent crimes compared to the reference category (TIME_OF_DAYEarly Morning).

One limitation of this study is the reliance on police-reported data, which may not capture all instances of crime. Underreporting or misclassification of incidents could result in biased estimates of violent crime prevalence and its predictors. Furthermore, the dataset excludes "unfounded" incidents, which might lead to an incomplete picture of crime dynamics. Future studies could incorporate alternative data sources, such as community surveys or hospital records, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of violent crime patterns.

This limitation addresses potential data collection biases while avoiding the geographic constraint. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!

Limitations
Data Constraints
One limitation of this study is the reliance on police-reported data, which may not capture all instances of crime. Underreporting or misclassification of incidents could result in biased estimates of violent crime prevalence and its predictors. Additionally, the dataset excludes "unfounded" incidents, potentially omitting meaningful cases where violent crimes were suspected but not verified. Future studies could incorporate alternative data sources, such as victim surveys or hospital records, to address these gaps and provide a more comprehensive analysis of crime patterns.

Simplification of Time Categories
Grouping time into four broad categories (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) simplifies the analysis but may obscure more detailed patterns of violent crime. For example, specific hours or transitions between periods (e.g., late evening to early morning) could exhibit distinct patterns that are not captured in the broader categories. Future research could employ finer temporal resolution to capture these nuances.

Contextual Variables
While this study focuses on premises type and time of day as predictors of violent crime, other contextual variables that influence crime dynamics were not included. Factors such as socioeconomic conditions, population density, and law enforcement presence at the time of the crime may play significant roles. Including these variables in future models could provide a more holistic understanding of crime predictors.

Generalizability
Although the findings provide insights into violent crime dynamics in Toronto, they may not fully apply to other urban areas with different socioeconomic, cultural, or environmental conditions. Future studies could replicate this analysis in diverse cities to assess the consistency of the observed patterns and predictors.

This version broadens the scope of limitations, addressing potential gaps in the variables used, generalizability, and the dataset's reliance on police-reported data. Let me know if you'd like to refine this further!

## Relationship between Premises Type and Violent Crime

The analysis highlights that premises type significantly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. Crimes occurring in "Transit" locations are strongly associated with higher odds of being classified as violent compared to the reference group ("Apartment"). This finding aligns with expectations, as transit environments often involve high volumes of people and limited surveillance, which may increase the potential for interpersonal conflicts. Similarly, "Outside" locations exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, likely due to their open and less controlled nature, which may facilitate confrontations or opportunistic violence. In contrast, premises such as "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with lower odds of violent crimes. Environments like schools or private residences, with greater structural or social control, tend to discourage violent activities. These intuitions underscore the importance of targeted safety measures in high-risk locations, such as enhancing surveillance in transit areas or increasing community policing efforts in outdoor public spaces.

## Relationship between Time of Day and Violent Crime

Time of day also plays a important role in determining the likelihood of violent crimes. The model results indicate that "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods are associated with elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the reference period ("Early Morning"). This pattern likely reflects increased social interactions and activities during these times, which may lead to heightened opportunities for conflicts or criminal acts. In contrast, "Morning" hours exhibit a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, possibly reflecting a time of day characterized by structured routines and reduced social friction. These findings highlight the need for time-sensitive interventions, such as increased police presence during evening hours or community-based programs to address the underlying causes of violent behavior during high-risk times.

## Implications for Policy and Prevention

The results inform practical strategies for crime prevention and public safety. For example, transit and outdoor areas, identified as high-risk premises, could benefit from increased surveillance, improved lighting, and targeted community engagement programs. Similarly, allocating law enforcement resources more strategically to focus on evening and afternoon periods could help deter violent crimes during these high-risk times. The findings also support urban planning efforts that enhance safety features in public spaces, such as the installation of security cameras and the promotion of neighborhood watch programs. By addressing the specific premises and times associated with violent crimes, policymakers can implement evidence-based strategies to reduce violence and improve community safety.

Implications for Practical Applications
To translate the findings of this study into actionable tools for stakeholders, we developed a RESTful API for predicting the likelihood of violent crimes based on premises type and time of day. This API allows users, such as law enforcement agencies and urban planners, to input specific contexts and receive real-time predictions on violent crime probability.

The API, implemented using the plumber package in R [@plumber], integrates the Bayesian logistic regression model developed in this study. It provides an intuitive interface for generating intuitions, enabling evidence-based decision-making for resource allocation and targeted interventions. This tool helps policymakers target high-risk scenarios more effectively.

## Limitations

### Data Constraints

One limitation of this study is the exclusion of crimes that could not be definitively classified as violent or non-violent. While necessary to ensure data consistency, this filtering process may omit incidents that could provide additional context for understanding violent crime dynamics. Future research should explore ways to include these ambiguous cases to improve the completeness of the analysis.

### Simplification of Time Categories

Grouping time into four broad categories (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) simplifies analysis but may obscure more granular patterns in violent crime occurrence. Future research could explore finer temporal granularity, such as analyzing crimes on an hourly basis, to capture additional distinctions in time-of-day effects.

## Future Steps

To enhance the utility and scope of this research, future studies should consider incorporating additional predictors, such as socioeconomic factors, neighborhood characteristics, or the presence of law enforcement resources. These variables could provide a more complete understanding of the conditions contributing to violent crimes. Additionally, integrating spatial analysis with precise location data could identify specific hotspots for targeted interventions. Policymakers and city planners could advantage these intuitions to allocate resources more effectively, reduce violent crimes, and promote public safety in Toronto and beyond.

ChatGPT said:
Here’s the revised and expanded discussion section in Quarto format. The revisions aim to deepen the analysis and extend the scope of inferences without repeating prior assertions or introducing redundancy, in alignment with the rubric.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Relationship between Premises Type and Violent Crime

The analysis underscores that premises type significantly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. Transit locations, often hubs of activity with limited surveillance, exhibit the highest odds of violent crimes. This aligns with urban safety theories suggesting that environments characterized by anonymity and low surveillance facilitate opportunistic and interpersonal violence. Similarly, outdoor areas, with their open and unregulated nature, remain high-risk zones for confrontations. In contrast, locations with inherent structural or social control, such as residential houses and schools, show markedly reduced odds of violent crimes. These findings emphasize the interplay between spatial control and crime likelihood, suggesting that environments fostering visibility, routine, and structural oversight are critical deterrents for violent activity. Policymakers might explore how urban designs, such as transit hubs with natural surveillance features, could mitigate risks in identified high-crime premises.

## Relationship between Time of Day and Violent Crime

Time of day has emerged as another critical determinant of violent crime patterns, reflecting the temporal rhythms of human activity. The elevated risk of violent crimes during afternoon and evening hours correlates with periods of heightened social interaction and mobility. Beyond the opportunity framework, this trend could also be linked to psychological and behavioral factors, such as stress accumulation or alcohol consumption patterns, which intensify during these hours. Morning hours, often structured by routines and higher institutional oversight, exhibit a stabilizing effect, further reinforcing the connection between predictability in human activity and crime reduction. These findings suggest that temporal interventions, such as staggered policing schedules or temporal zoning laws, could play a key role in mitigating violence during high-risk periods.

## Expanding Implications for Policy and Prevention

### Integrative Safety Planning

Building upon the findings, integrating urban design with crime prevention could yield significant dividends. For instance, redesigning transit hubs with open sightlines and enhanced illumination may disrupt anonymity and reduce violent crime opportunities. Similarly, encouraging the adoption of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles in outdoor public spaces could transform potential high-crime locations into safer environments. Measures like pedestrian-oriented lighting, community-centric activities in outdoor spaces, and visible security features would align with these findings to promote safer urban environments.

### Socioeconomic Dimensions of Intervention

While the current study primarily addresses spatial and temporal patterns, incorporating socioeconomic factors into crime prevention strategies could provide a more holistic framework. For instance, transit areas may not only be risky due to environmental factors but also because they serve as nexus points for marginalized populations. Acknowledging these dynamics, policymakers could complement structural safety measures with socioeconomic upliftment programs, such as housing initiatives near transit hubs or employment opportunities targeting vulnerable demographics.

### Strategic Resource Allocation

The predictive insights offered by this study support law enforcement agencies in adopting data-driven approaches for resource allocation. By utilizing the RESTful API developed from this study, stakeholders can simulate various scenarios to predict high-risk situations and proactively deploy resources to mitigate risks. Expanding the API’s capabilities to integrate real-time data inputs, such as weather or crowd density, could further enhance its utility for dynamic and responsive safety planning.

## Methodological and Data Constraints

### Broader Patterns of Reporting Bias

One critical limitation of this study lies in its reliance on police-reported crime data, which may not fully capture the spectrum of violent incidents, particularly in communities with lower trust in law enforcement. Future work could integrate alternative data sources, such as victim surveys or hospital records, to triangulate findings and improve the representativeness of results.

### Contextual Variability

Although temporal and premises patterns are insightful, crime trends are also shaped by contextual factors such as socio-political events, public holidays, or local enforcement initiatives. These dynamic variables remain unexplored in this study but represent fertile ground for subsequent analyses. For example, assessing the impact of large public events or seasonal festivals on violent crime rates could enrich the temporal dimensions of future research.

## Expanding Future Directions

### Spatial Granularity

To deepen insights into crime dynamics, future studies could leverage GIS technologies to create micro-level spatial analyses, identifying precise hotspots within broader categories like transit or outdoor spaces. This approach would allow targeted interventions down to the neighborhood or block level, maximizing the efficiency of crime prevention strategies.

### Temporal and Behavioral Factors

Extending temporal analysis to finer granularities, such as hourly crime trends or correlations with real-time behavioral indicators (e.g., crowd density, alcohol sales), could further clarify the dynamics influencing violent crimes. Behavioral data, combined with existing predictors, might reveal interaction effects, such as the combined influence of high transit activity and late evening hours.

### Holistic Models Incorporating External Predictors

The current Bayesian logistic regression model could be expanded to include additional predictors like socioeconomic indices, law enforcement density, or public service availability. Incorporating these factors would yield a multidimensional understanding of violent crime, enabling policymakers to balance preventive measures with social equity considerations.

## Conclusion

By bridging spatial and temporal patterns of violent crime with actionable insights, this study provides a foundation for targeted interventions and evidence-based policymaking. While the current scope highlights critical premises and periods, future expansions integrating socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental dimensions could transform our understanding and prevention of violent crime in urban spaces.

While the current study primarily addresses spatial and temporal patterns, incorporating socioeconomic factors into crime prevention strategies could provide a more holistic framework. For instance, transit areas may not only be risky due to environmental factors but also because they serve as nexus points for marginalized populations. Acknowledging these dynamics, policymakers could complement structural safety measures with socioeconomic upliftment programs, such as housing initiatives near transit hubs or employment opportunities targeting vulnerable demographics.

### Strategic Resource Allocation

The predictive insights offered by this study support law enforcement agencies in adopting data-driven approaches for resource allocation. By utilizing the RESTful API developed from this study, stakeholders can simulate various scenarios to predict high-risk situations and proactively deploy resources to mitigate risks. Expanding the API’s capabilities to integrate real-time data inputs, such as weather or crowd density, could further enhance its utility for dynamic and responsive safety planning.

## Limitations {#sec-limitations}

### Data Constraints

The study relies on police-reported crime data, which inherently excludes unreported incidents. This limitation is particularly salient in areas with historically low trust in law enforcement, where individuals may hesitate to report crimes. As a result, the findings may underestimate the true extent of violent crime or misrepresent its distribution. Future research could integrate alternative sources, such as hospital records or victim surveys, to address this gap.

### Simplification of Time Categories

Grouping time into four broad categories (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) provides clarity but obscures finer temporal variations. For example, crimes occurring at transitional times, such as dusk or early evening, may exhibit unique patterns not captured by the current framework. Future studies should explore more granular time intervals, potentially aligning with shifts in social activity or crowd behaviors.

### Contextual Variability

External factors, such as seasonal festivals, socio-political events, or local policing strategies, may influence crime trends but were not accounted for in this study. While July was selected as a high-risk month, the findings may not generalize across other seasons or contexts. Future analyses should incorporate these dynamic influences to provide a more comprehensive understanding of violent crime dynamics.

## Expanding Future Directions

### Spatial Granularity

To deepen insights into crime dynamics, future studies could leverage GIS technologies to create micro-level spatial analyses, identifying precise hotspots within broader categories like transit or outdoor spaces. This approach would allow targeted interventions down to the neighborhood or block level, maximizing the efficiency of crime prevention strategies.

### Temporal and Behavioral Factors

Extending temporal analysis to finer granularities, such as hourly crime trends or correlations with real-time behavioral indicators (e.g., crowd density, alcohol sales), could further clarify the dynamics influencing violent crimes. Behavioral data, combined with existing predictors, might reveal interaction effects, such as the combined influence of high transit activity and late evening hours.

### Holistic Models Incorporating External Predictors

The current Bayesian logistic regression model could be expanded to include additional predictors like socioeconomic indices, law enforcement density, or public service availability. Incorporating these factors would yield a multidimensional understanding of violent crime, enabling policymakers to balance preventive measures with social equity considerations.

## Conclusion

By bridging spatial and temporal patterns of violent crime with actionable insights, this study provides a foundation for targeted interventions and evidence-based policymaking. While the current scope highlights critical premises and periods, future expansions integrating socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental dimensions could transform our understanding and prevention of violent crime in urban spaces.

# Introduction

## Overview

This study examines the factors influencing the likelihood of violent crimes in Toronto, focusing on two important predictors: the type of premises where the crime occurred and the time of day. Violent crime, encompassing offenses such as assault and robbery, poses significant risks to community safety and requires evidence-based strategies for prevention. Non-violent crimes, such as theft and property-related offenses, provide a contrasting baseline for analysis.

Using a detailed dataset. from the Toronto Police Service, this research aims to uncover patterns and relationships between the environment, timing, and the probability of violent crimes. By leveraging Bayesian logistic regression modeling, the study accounts for uncertainty while using prior knowledge to generate practical findings. The findings aim to inform crime prevention efforts, resource allocation, and urban safety policies by identifying high-risk contexts for violence.


## Estimand
The primary estimand of this study is the probability of a violent crime occurring given specific premises (e.g., residential, commercial, or transit) and the time of day (e.g., early morning, evening). Violent crimes include serious offenses such as assaults and robberies, while non-violent crimes encompass thefts and similar offenses. This research employs a Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate these probabilities, accounting for uncertainty and using prior knowledge.

## Results Summary

The results of this study provide clarity on the relationship between premises type, time of day, and the likelihood of a crime being violent. Premises such as "Transit" and "Outside" exhibit greater odds of violent crimes compared to the reference category ("Apartment"), reflecting their open and public nature, which may increase opportunities for conflicts. Conversely, premises like "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with a lower likelihood of violent crimes, underscoring the role of structural and social controls in reducing violence.

Time of day also plays a significant role, with "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods showing elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the baseline "Early Morning." These findings align with patterns of increased social interactions and activities during these periods. The credible interval plots further confirm the statistical significance of these predictors, emphasizing their impact on crime likelihood. Overall, the results highlight patterns that can guide focused crime prevention strategies in high-risk locations and time periods.


## Why This Study Matters

Understanding the contextual factors contributing to violent crimes can help city planners and policymakers allocate safety interventions effectively. This research focuses on premises and times of day where the likelihood of violence is highest, enabling tailored prevention strategies. The findings from this study can directly impact resource allocation for policing and urban planning, potentially reducing crime rates and enhancing public safety.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR] to process, clean, and analyze the dataset for this study. Key R packages employed include tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization [@thereferencecanbewhatever], arrow for efficient data storage and retrieval [@arrowR], here for managing file paths [@here], rstanarm for Bayesian modeling [@rstanarm], kableExtra for enhanced table formatting [@kableExtra], janitor for cleaning messy data [@janitor], lubridate for working with dates and times [@lubridate], marginaleffects for calculating marginal effects [@marginaleffects], plumber for creating REST APIs [@plumber], testthat for unit testing [@testthat], and opendatatoronto for accessing Toronto’s open data [@opendatatoronto].

Our data is sourced from the Open Data Toronto portal [@OpenDataToronto], specifically from the "Motor Vehicle Collisions Involving Killed or Seriously Injured Persons" dataset, which captures detailed information on traffic incidents in Toronto where individuals were either killed or seriously injured. This dataset, compiled by the Toronto Police Service, includes variables that record the time, location, environmental conditions, and specific parties involved in each collision, showing factors that may increase the risk of severe outcomes.

The detailed information within the dataset enables a rigorous analysis of patterns in collision severity. By examining factors such as driver condition, road surface, and lighting conditions, we aim to identify high-risk scenarios that may require targeted safety interventions. Following principles outlined in "Telling Stories with Data" [@tellingstories], this study prioritizes transparency and reproducibility in presenting findings that can inform road safety policies.


## Measurement

The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Toronto Police Service and includes records of Major Crime Indicators (MCI) occurrences. These records capture information on five important categories of crime: Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery, and Theft Over. Unlike some crime datasets, this dataset excludes occurrences classified as "unfounded," meaning that only verified incidents are included. The definition of "unfounded," provided by Statistics Canada, is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted.”

To align with the study’s focus on temporal and environmental factors influencing violent crime, we selected crimes reported during the month of July. This decision was informed by research highlighting July as a high-risk period for violent crimes due to its status as one of the warmest months globally and its alignment with peak social activity [@JulyTemperatureRecords; @SeasonalityOfCrime]. Higher temperatures during July have been linked to increased aggression and lowered inhibition, a phenomenon described by the "Temperature/Aggression" theory [@SeasonalityOfCrime]. Moreover, the Routine Activities theory explains that greater public activity in July provides more opportunities for interaction between offenders and victims, potentially elevating crime rates [@SeasonalityOfCrime].

The data collection process primarily relies on police-reported incidents. However, there are certain limitations in the completeness of the dataset. For example, some location coordinates are missing or left blank when the location could not be verified. Additionally, the dataset includes occurrences that are located outside the City of Toronto, which may slightly affect the analysis for Toronto-specific crime trends. 

Spatial data in the dataset is provided using both the old 140-neighborhood structure and the newer 158-neighborhood structure for the City of Toronto. This dual structure ensures compatibility across different time periods and administrative updates. Temporal data includes detailed timestamps that allow crimes to be categorized by time of day and season.

The unit of measurement for numerical data, such as timestamps and neighborhood IDs, is standard counts or identifiers with no inherent units. Other features, such as crime type, premises type, and time of day, are categorical variables with no associated units.

Although the data provides a robust framework for understanding crime patterns in Toronto, some aspects are modeled or incomplete. For instance, location data for certain crimes may be estimated, and the dataset does not include crimes that were not reported to the police. Despite these limitations, the dataset remains a useful resource for analyzing environmental and temporal factors influencing violent and non-violent crimes in Toronto.


## Data Cleaning

The raw crime data underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to prepare it for analysis, ensuring the dataset was both relevant and consistent for the study's objectives. Initially, only key columns were selected from the raw dataset, including EVENT_UNIQUE_ID (Unique Identifier), REPORT_DATE (Date of Report), OCC_HOUR (Hour of Occurrence), PREMISES_TYPE (Type of Premises), and OFFENCE (Offense Type). This selection ensured that only the most pertinent information was included for examining factors associated with violent crimes.

Rows with missing or irrelevant data in important columns, such as EVENT_UNIQUE_ID, PREMISES_TYPE, TIME_OF_DAY, and VIOLENT_CRIME, were removed to maintain data integrity and focus on valid observations. Offenses were categorized as either violent or non-violent to create a binary outcome variable (VIOLENT_CRIME), where offenses such as "Assault" and "Robbery" were classified as violent (1), and crimes like "Theft" or "Break and Enter" were classified as non-violent (0). Offenses that did not fit into either category were excluded from the dataset.

To analyze temporal patterns, the OCC_HOUR variable was grouped into broader time categories:

- **Early Morning**: 12 AM to 6 AM  
- **Morning**: 6 AM to 12 PM  
- **Afternoon**: 12 PM to 6 PM  
- **Evening**: 6 PM to 12 AM  

Additionally, the PREMISES_TYPE variable, which describes the type of location where the incident occurred, was trimmed to remove excess whitespace and ensure consistent formatting. This step was crucial to prevent unexpected NA values during analysis.

The cleaning process also included filtering for crimes reported during the summer month of July, aligning the dataset with the study's focus on temporal and environmental patterns in criminal activity. After grouping, formatting, and filtering the data, all rows containing NA values in important columns were dropped to ensure a clean and analyzable dataset.

Finally, the cleaned dataset was saved as a Parquet file for further analysis. This format ensures efficient storage and retrieval while preserving the structure of the data.



## Outcome variable

The primary outcome variable in this study is Violent Crime, which categorizes each incident based on whether the crime is classified as violent or non-violent. Violent crime is coded as a binary variable, where "0" represents non-violent offenses (e.g., theft, break and enter), and "1" denotes violent offenses (e.g., assault, robbery). This classification allows for an assessment of factors contributing to the likelihood of a crime being violent, providing a framework for understanding the underlying conditions associated with violent behavior.

By focusing on crimes involving violence, this outcome variable highlights important cases of interest for public safety and crime prevention efforts, as violent offenses often have severe consequences for victims and communities. This binary categorization simplifies the statistical analysis, enabling the application of logistic regression models to estimate the probability of violent crimes under varying conditions.

Analyzing violent crime in conjunction with predictor variables such as premises type and time of day helps identify the circumstances under which the risk of violence is heightened. This outcome measure serves as a crucial indicator for assessing and improving community safety policies, as it reflects the most serious consequences of criminal activity and directs attention to factors that could reduce violent incidents.

## Predictor variables

@fig-premises-type illustrates the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes across different premises types. The results show that the highest number of crimes, both violent and non-violent, occur in "Outside" locations, followed by "Apartment" premises. Notably, violent crimes significantly outnumber non-violent ones in "Outside" locations, while "Apartments" and "Houses" have a more balanced distribution between the two crime types. Premises categorized as "Educational," "Transit," and "Other" show relatively low numbers of both violent and non-violent crimes, with "Educational" premises having the fewest incidents overall.

@fig-time-of-day highlights the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes by the time of day. The data reveals that violent crimes are most common during the "Evening," followed by "Afternoon" and "Early Morning." In contrast, non-violent crimes are more evenly distributed throughout the day but still peak during the "Evening." These findings suggest that the time of day plays a important role in influencing the likelihood of violent crimes, with evenings being a particularly high-risk period.

By examining these distributions, we gain insights into where and when violent crimes are most likely to occur. Understanding these patterns is essential for developing focused crime prevention strategies, such as increasing law enforcement presence in high-risk areas during evening hours or implementing community-based interventions in "Outside" locations.

# Model {#sec-model}

In our analysis, we utilized a Bayesian logistic regression model to examine the relationship between violent crime occurrence and two important predictors: premises type and time of day. By using this model, we aimed to understand how the location and timing of incidents influence the likelihood of a crime being classified as violent. Detailed model diagnostics and background are provided in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

\text{logit}(\pi_i) &= \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{PREMISES\_TYPE}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{TIME\_OF\_DAY}_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_1 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_2 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)
\end{align}

In this model:

- $\beta_1$ is the coefficient corresponding to the type of premises (\texttt{PREMISES\_TYPE}$_i$) where the crime occurred.

- $\beta_2$ is the coefficient corresponding to the time of day (\texttt{TIME\_OF\_DAY}$_i$) when the crime occurred.



The logistic link function ($\text{logit}(\pi_i)$) models the log-odds of violent crime as a linear combination of the predictors. The priors for the intercept ($\alpha$) and the coefficients ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$) follow a Normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $2.5$. These priors regularize the model, constraining the parameters to plausible values based on prior knowledge.

This Bayesian logistic regression model was implemented using the rstanarm package, leveraging Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for parameter estimation. Further diagnostics and posterior summaries are discussed in the supplementary materials (see Appendix @sec-model-details).


## Model Justification

Each predictor in the model represents a specific characteristic of the crime and its context, with hypothesized effects on the likelihood of violent crime. For PREMISES_TYPE, it is expected that certain locations, such as "Transit" or "Outside," may have higher odds of violent crime due to increased public interactions or a lack of controlled environments. Conversely, premises like "Educational" or "House" are anticipated to have lower odds of violent crime, reflecting their relatively private or structured settings. Locations categorized as "Other" may include mixed contexts, resulting in varying effects.

For TIME_OF_DAY, it is hypothesized that the "Evening" period may exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, as this time is often associated with increased social activities and potential for interpersonal conflict. "Early Morning" may also show elevated odds due to decreased public surveillance and fewer witnesses. In contrast, "Morning" and "Afternoon" are expected to have lower odds, reflecting typical daytime routines with higher levels of oversight and structured activity.

By incorporating these predictors into the Bayesian logistic regression model, this study seeks to identify and quantify the relationships between crime characteristics and the likelihood of violent outcomes, providing practical findings for targeted interventions.

# Results {#sec-result}

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults. The findings align with our expectations, providing insights into how premises type and time of day influence the likelihood of violent crimes. To avoid multicollinearity, the model excludes one level from each categorical predictor as the reference group: "Apartment" for PREMISES_TYPE and "Early Morning" for TIME_OF_DAY. The intercept represents the estimated log-odds of violent crime occurring when all other predictors are held constant at their reference levels. In this case, the estimated log-odds of a violent crime occurring at an "Apartment" during "Early Morning" is 0.881.

The type of premises strongly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. For instance, crimes occurring in "Transit" premises are far more likely to be violent compared to the reference group. The estimated coefficient for PREMISES_TYPETransit is 2.363, indicating a substantial increase in the log-odds of violent crime in this context. On the other hand, crimes occurring in "Commercial" and "Educational" premises are less likely to be violent, with coefficients of -0.925 and -0.957, respectively. Similarly, crimes at "House" premises exhibit the lowest likelihood of violence, as reflected by a coefficient of -1.519. These results highlight that location plays a important role in determining whether a crime is violent or non-violent.

Time of day also significantly impacts the likelihood of violent crimes. Compared to the reference level of "Early Morning," the coefficients for TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon and TIME_OF_DAYEvening are 0.413 and 0.325, respectively, suggesting an elevated likelihood of violent crimes during these times. The "Morning" time of day exhibits a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, as shown by a coefficient of 0.074.

Figure 7 (see Section B.3) shows the range of coefficient estimates for our model within the 90% probability interval. However, because the credibility intervals for several predictors are relatively narrow, particularly for premises types like "Transit," it is challenging to observe the trends clearly. To address this, Figure 8 was created with the x-axis limited to a range of -5 to 5. Combining Figures 7 and 8, we observe statistical significance for several predictors, including "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," as their credibility intervals do not cross zero.

The coefficients are reported in log-odds, where a positive value indicates an increased likelihood of violent crime, and a negative value reflects a decreased likelihood. The results demonstrate clear statistical significance for important predictors such as "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," emphasizing the importance of both location and time of day in shaping violent crime outcomes.


# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Relationship between Premises Type and Violent Crime

The analysis highlights that premises type significantly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. Crimes occurring in "Transit" locations are strongly associated with higher odds of being classified as violent compared to the reference group ("Apartment"). This finding aligns with expectations, as transit environments often involve high volumes of people and limited surveillance, which may increase the potential for interpersonal conflicts. Similarly, "Outside" locations exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, likely due to their open and less controlled nature, which may facilitate confrontations or opportunistic violence. In contrast, premises such as "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with lower odds of violent crimes. These findings suggest that environments with greater structural or social control (e.g., schools, private residences) are less conducive to violent activities. These insights underscore the importance of targeted safety measures in high-risk locations, such as enhancing surveillance in transit areas or increasing community policing efforts in outdoor public spaces.

## Relationship between Time of Day and Violent Crime

Time of day also plays a important role in determining the likelihood of violent crimes. The model results indicate that "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods are associated with elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the reference period ("Early Morning"). This pattern likely reflects increased social interactions and activities during these times, which may lead to heightened opportunities for conflicts or criminal acts. In contrast, "Morning" hours exhibit a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, possibly reflecting a time of day characterized by structured routines and reduced social friction. These findings highlight the need for time-sensitive interventions, such as increased police presence during evening hours or community-based programs to address the underlying causes of violent behavior during high-risk times.

## Implications for Policy and Prevention

The results provide practical findings for crime prevention and public safety policies. For example, transit and outdoor areas, identified as high-risk premises, could benefit from increased surveillance, improved lighting, and targeted community engagement programs. Similarly, allocating law enforcement resources more strategically to focus on evening and afternoon periods could help deter violent crimes during these high-risk times. The findings also support urban planning efforts that enhance safety features in public spaces, such as the installation of security cameras and the promotion of neighborhood watch programs. By addressing the specific premises and times associated with violent crimes, policymakers can implement evidence-based strategies to reduce violence and improve community safety.

Implications for Practical Applications
To translate the findings of this study into actionable tools for stakeholders, we developed a RESTful API for predicting the likelihood of violent crimes based on premises type and time of day. This API allows users, such as law enforcement agencies and urban planners, to input specific contexts and receive real-time predictions on violent crime probability.

The API, implemented using the plumber package in R [@plumber], integrates the Bayesian logistic regression model developed in this study. It provides an intuitive interface for generating insights, enabling evidence-based decision-making for resource allocation and targeted interventions. By leveraging this tool, policymakers can proactively address high-risk scenarios and improve community safety.

## Limitations

### Data Constraints

One limitation of this study is the exclusion of crimes that could not be definitively classified as violent or non-violent. While necessary to ensure data consistency, this filtering process may omit incidents that could provide additional context for understanding violent crime dynamics. Future research should explore ways to include these ambiguous cases to improve the comprehensiveness of the analysis.

### Simplification of Time Categories

Grouping time into four broad categories (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) simplifies analysis but may obscure more granular patterns in violent crime occurrence. Future research could explore finer temporal granularity, such as analyzing crimes on an hourly basis, to capture additional nuances in time-of-day effects.

## Future Steps

To enhance the utility and scope of this research, future studies should consider incorporating additional predictors, such as socioeconomic factors, neighborhood characteristics, or the presence of law enforcement resources. These variables could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions contributing to violent crimes. Additionally, integrating spatial analysis with precise location data could identify specific hotspots for targeted interventions. Policymakers and city planners could leverage these insights to allocate resources more effectively, reduce violent crimes, and promote public safety in Toronto and beyond.

# Model details {#sec-model-details}

## Posterior Predictive Check and Prior-Posterior Comparison

The posterior predictive check in @fig-post_dist provides an evaluation of how well the Bayesian logistic regression model replicates the observed data. The posterior distribution ($y_{\text{rep}}$) closely aligns with the observed data ($y$), indicating that the model provides a good fit and captures the essential patterns in the data.

In @fig-post_prior, the posterior distributions of the model parameters are compared against their priors. This visual comparison highlights how the observed data influenced the posterior estimates. For instance, predictors such as PREMISES_TYPETransit and TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon show a notable shift in their posterior distributions compared to the priors, reflecting strong evidence provided by the data. Conversely, predictors with minimal shifts suggest less data-driven evidence or smaller effects on the model outcome.

## Diagnostics {#sec-diagnostics}

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo Convergence Check

To assess the convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for the Bayesian logistic regression model, trace plots and Rhat plots were analyzed. These diagnostics are crucial to ensure that the chains mix well and converge to a stable distribution, providing reliable parameter estimates.

#### Trace Plots

@fig-trace-premise and @fig-trace-time display the trace plots for the model's intercept, premises type predictors, and time of day predictors. Each plot shows the sampled parameter values across iterations for all four chains.

- **Premises Type Predictors**: As seen in @fig-trace-premise, the chains for predictors like House, Commercial, Educational, and Outside fluctuate around stable mean values, indicating good mixing and convergence.
- **Time of Day Predictors**: @fig-trace-time illustrates the trace plots for Morning, Afternoon, and Evening time categories, along with Transit Premises. The chains for these predictors also show no significant trends or drift, confirming convergence.

## 90% Credibility Interval {#sec-credibility-interval}

Figures @fig-modelresults1 and @fig-modelresults2 visualize the 90% credible intervals for the predictors in the Bayesian logistic regression model. These plots provide insights into the uncertainty surrounding the estimated coefficients for each predictor.

Figure @fig-modelresults1 displays the 90% credible intervals for all predictors without restrictions on the x-axis. This plot shows how the predictors such as PREMISES_TYPE and TIME_OF_DAY influence the likelihood of violent crimes. For example, PREMISES_TYPETransit has a high positive credible interval, indicating a significant increase in the likelihood of violent crime in transit areas. Conversely, PREMISES_TYPECommercial and PREMISES_TYPEEducational have negative credible intervals, indicating a lower likelihood of violent crimes in these premises types.

In Figure @fig-modelresults2, the x-axis has been restricted to a range of -5 to 5 to better visualize predictors with smaller intervals. This refined view helps highlight subtle but meaningful differences between categories like TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon and TIME_OF_DAYEvening, which show a noticeable increase in the likelihood of violent crimes compared to the reference category (TIME_OF_DAYEarly Morning).

	- Each row of the main dataset represents an individual in a household.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- There are 157,959 instances.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a sample. The larger set should be all the people in the United States of America. The sample is not fully representative of the larger set. Even though the sample takes various demographic variables into consideration, there are still people in the US who are not surveyed. This creates a potential problem that some people with different age, race, and background might not be accounted for. 
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance consists of different demographic and financial information of each participant in this survey.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No. There is unique identifier for each household, however, if there are more than one person in the household, these people will have the same identifier since they live in the same household.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- No.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- No, since there is no unique identifier associated with each individual instance.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- No.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- There is some human uncertainties in the dataset, for example, respondents might report false information in the survey.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- Self-contained.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Yes, age and race. 
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- Maybe. If you include other information like government benefit programs with this information, you might be able to cross reference some individuals.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes, financial information is contained in this dataset.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- No.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*

this is the stuff that come after the markdown above, 

i was told that

This is deliberately broad to allow you to show off your knowledge about surveys, sampling or observational data, in a way that makes sense.

So some of your suggestions - hypothetical survey + sampling approach, maybe including some references and simulation - would make sense in your case.

A Bayesian logistic regression model reveals that violent crimes are more likely to occur in transit and outdoor locations compared to residential and educational premises. Crimes are also more likely to be violent during afternoon and evening hours than early mornings. These findings offer critical insights for urban safety planning and targeted crime prevention strategies."

# Introduction

## Overview

This study examines the factors influencing the likelihood of violent crimes in Toronto, focusing on two important predictors: the type of premises where the crime occurred and the time of day. Violent crime, encompassing offenses such as assault and robbery, poses significant risks to community safety and requires evidence-based strategies for prevention. Non-violent crimes, such as theft and property-related offenses, provide a contrasting baseline for analysis.

Using a detailed dataset. from the Toronto Police Service, this research aims to uncover patterns and relationships between the environment, timing, and the probability of violent crimes. By leveraging Bayesian logistic regression modeling, the study accounts for uncertainty while using prior knowledge to generate practical findings. The findings aim to inform crime prevention efforts, resource allocation, and urban safety policies by identifying high-risk contexts for violence.


## Estimand
The primary estimand of this study is the probability of a violent crime occurring given specific premises (e.g., residential, commercial, or transit) and the time of day (e.g., early morning, evening). Violent crimes include serious offenses such as assaults and robberies, while non-violent crimes encompass thefts and similar offenses. This research employs a Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate these probabilities, accounting for uncertainty and using prior knowledge.

## Results Summary

The results of this study provide clarity on the relationship between premises type, time of day, and the likelihood of a crime being violent. Premises such as "Transit" and "Outside" exhibit greater odds of violent crimes compared to the reference category ("Apartment"), reflecting their open and public nature, which may increase opportunities for conflicts. Conversely, premises like "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with a lower likelihood of violent crimes, underscoring the role of structural and social controls in reducing violence.

Time of day also plays a significant role, with "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods showing elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the baseline "Early Morning." These findings align with patterns of increased social interactions and activities during these periods. The credible interval plots further confirm the statistical significance of these predictors, emphasizing their impact on crime likelihood. Overall, the results highlight patterns that can guide focused crime prevention strategies in high-risk locations and time periods.


## Why This Study Matters

Understanding the contextual factors contributing to violent crimes can help city planners and policymakers allocate safety interventions effectively. This research focuses on premises and times of day where the likelihood of violence is highest, enabling tailored prevention strategies. The findings from this study can directly impact resource allocation for policing and urban planning, potentially reducing crime rates and enhancing public safety.

## Paper Structure

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In @sec-data, we present an overview of the dataset used in this study, along with a detailed description of the variables and the data cleaning process. @sec-model outlines the Bayesian logistic regression model applied in our analysis, including the model setup, assumptions, and justification. In @sec-result, we summarize the results of our analysis and interpret the findings within the context of existing literature on road safety. Finally, @sec-discussion discusses the implications of these findings, acknowledges the limitations of the study, and suggests directions for future research.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR] to process, clean, and analyze the dataset for this study. Key R packages employed include tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization [@thereferencecanbewhatever], arrow for efficient data storage and retrieval [@arrowR], here for managing file paths [@here], rstanarm for Bayesian modeling [@rstanarm], kableExtra for enhanced table formatting [@kableExtra], janitor for cleaning messy data [@janitor], lubridate for working with dates and times [@lubridate], marginaleffects for calculating marginal effects [@marginaleffects], plumber for creating REST APIs [@plumber], testthat for unit testing [@testthat], and opendatatoronto for accessing Toronto’s open data [@opendatatoronto].

Our data is sourced from the Open Data Toronto portal [@OpenDataToronto], specifically from the "Motor Vehicle Collisions Involving Killed or Seriously Injured Persons" dataset, which captures detailed information on traffic incidents in Toronto where individuals were either killed or seriously injured. This dataset, compiled by the Toronto Police Service, includes variables that record the time, location, environmental conditions, and specific parties involved in each collision, showing factors that may increase the risk of severe outcomes.

The detailed information within the dataset enables a rigorous analysis of patterns in collision severity. By examining factors such as driver condition, road surface, and lighting conditions, we aim to identify high-risk scenarios that may require targeted safety interventions. Following principles outlined in "Telling Stories with Data" [@tellingstories], this study prioritizes transparency and reproducibility in presenting findings that can inform road safety policies.


## Measurement

The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Toronto Police Service and includes records of Major Crime Indicators (MCI) occurrences. These records capture information on five important categories of crime: Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery, and Theft Over. Unlike some crime datasets, this dataset excludes occurrences classified as "unfounded," meaning that only verified incidents are included. The definition of "unfounded," provided by Statistics Canada, is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted.”

The data collection process primarily relies on police-reported incidents. However, there are certain limitations in the completeness of the dataset. For example, some location coordinates are missing or left blank when the location could not be verified. Additionally, the dataset includes occurrences that are located outside the City of Toronto, which may slightly affect the analysis for Toronto-specific crime trends. 

Spatial data in the dataset is provided using both the old 140-neighborhood structure and the newer 158-neighborhood structure for the City of Toronto. This dual structure ensures compatibility across different time periods and administrative updates. Temporal data includes detailed timestamps that allow crimes to be categorized by time of day and season.

The unit of measurement for numerical data, such as timestamps and neighborhood IDs, is standard counts or identifiers with no inherent units. Other features, such as crime type, premises type, and time of day, are categorical variables with no associated units.

Although the data provides a robust framework for understanding crime patterns in Toronto, some aspects are modeled or incomplete. For instance, location data for certain crimes may be estimated, and the dataset does not include crimes that were not reported to the police. Despite these limitations, the dataset remains a useful resource for analyzing environmental and temporal factors influencing violent and non-violent crimes in Toronto.


## Data Cleaning

The raw crime data underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to prepare it for analysis, ensuring the dataset was both relevant and consistent for the study's objectives. Initially, only key columns were selected from the raw dataset, including EVENT_UNIQUE_ID (Unique Identifier), REPORT_DATE (Date of Report), OCC_HOUR (Hour of Occurrence), PREMISES_TYPE (Type of Premises), and OFFENCE (Offense Type). This selection ensured that only the most pertinent information was included for examining factors associated with violent crimes.

Rows with missing or irrelevant data in important columns, such as EVENT_UNIQUE_ID, PREMISES_TYPE, TIME_OF_DAY, and VIOLENT_CRIME, were removed to maintain data integrity and focus on valid observations. Offenses were categorized as either violent or non-violent to create a binary outcome variable (VIOLENT_CRIME), where offenses such as "Assault" and "Robbery" were classified as violent (1), and crimes like "Theft" or "Break and Enter" were classified as non-violent (0). Offenses that did not fit into either category were excluded from the dataset.

To analyze temporal patterns, the OCC_HOUR variable was grouped into broader time categories:

- **Early Morning**: 12 AM to 6 AM  
- **Morning**: 6 AM to 12 PM  
- **Afternoon**: 12 PM to 6 PM  
- **Evening**: 6 PM to 12 AM  

Additionally, the PREMISES_TYPE variable, which describes the type of location where the incident occurred, was trimmed to remove excess whitespace and ensure consistent formatting. This step was crucial to prevent unexpected NA values during analysis.

The cleaning process also included filtering for crimes reported during the summer month of July, aligning the dataset with the study's focus on temporal and environmental patterns in criminal activity. After grouping, formatting, and filtering the data, all rows containing NA values in important columns were dropped to ensure a clean and analyzable dataset.

Finally, the cleaned dataset was saved as a Parquet file for further analysis. This format ensures efficient storage and retrieval while preserving the structure of the data.



## Outcome variable

The primary outcome variable in this study is Violent Crime, which categorizes each incident based on whether the crime is classified as violent or non-violent. Violent crime is coded as a binary variable, where "0" represents non-violent offenses (e.g., theft, break and enter), and "1" denotes violent offenses (e.g., assault, robbery). This classification allows for an assessment of factors contributing to the likelihood of a crime being violent, providing a framework for understanding the underlying conditions associated with violent behavior.

By focusing on crimes involving violence, this outcome variable highlights important cases of interest for public safety and crime prevention efforts, as violent offenses often have severe consequences for victims and communities. This binary categorization simplifies the statistical analysis, enabling the application of logistic regression models to estimate the probability of violent crimes under varying conditions.

Analyzing violent crime in conjunction with predictor variables such as premises type and time of day helps identify the circumstances under which the risk of violence is heightened. This outcome measure serves as a crucial indicator for assessing and improving community safety policies, as it reflects the most serious consequences of criminal activity and directs attention to factors that could reduce violent incidents.

## Predictor variables

@fig-premises-type illustrates the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes across different premises types. The results show that the highest number of crimes, both violent and non-violent, occur in "Outside" locations, followed by "Apartment" premises. Notably, violent crimes significantly outnumber non-violent ones in "Outside" locations, while "Apartments" and "Houses" have a more balanced distribution between the two crime types. Premises categorized as "Educational," "Transit," and "Other" show relatively low numbers of both violent and non-violent crimes, with "Educational" premises having the fewest incidents overall.

@fig-time-of-day highlights the distribution of violent versus non-violent crimes by the time of day. The data reveals that violent crimes are most common during the "Evening," followed by "Afternoon" and "Early Morning." In contrast, non-violent crimes are more evenly distributed throughout the day but still peak during the "Evening." These findings suggest that the time of day plays a important role in influencing the likelihood of violent crimes, with evenings being a particularly high-risk period.

By examining these distributions, we gain insights into where and when violent crimes are most likely to occur. Understanding these patterns is essential for developing focused crime prevention strategies, such as increasing law enforcement presence in high-risk areas during evening hours or implementing community-based interventions in "Outside" locations.

# Model {#sec-model}

In our analysis, we utilized a Bayesian logistic regression model to examine the relationship between violent crime occurrence and two important predictors: premises type and time of day. By using this model, we aimed to understand how the location and timing of incidents influence the likelihood of a crime being classified as violent. Detailed model diagnostics and background are provided in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model Set-up

\begin{align} 
y_i|\pi_i &\sim \text{Bern}(\pi_i) \\
\text{logit}(\pi_i) &= \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{PREMISES\_TYPE}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{TIME\_OF\_DAY}_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_1 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_2 &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)
\end{align}

In this model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i & \text{ represents the binary outcome variable indicating whether a crime is classified as violent (1 for violent crimes, 0 for non-violent crimes).} \\
\pi_i & \text{ is the predicted probability of a violent crime.} \\
\alpha & \text{ is the intercept term of this logistic regression. It is the baseline log-odds of a violent crime when all predictors are at their reference levels.} \\
\beta_1 & \text{ is the coefficient corresponding to the type of premises (\(\text{PREMISES_TYPE}_i\)) where the crime occurred.} \\
\beta_2 & \text{ is the coefficient corresponding to the time of day (\(\text{TIME_OF_DAY}_i\)) when the crime occurred.}
\end{aligned}
$$


The logistic link function ($\text{logit}(\pi_i)$) models the log-odds of violent crime as a linear combination of the predictors. The priors for the intercept ($\alpha$) and the coefficients ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$) follow a Normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $2.5$. These priors regularize the model, constraining the parameters to plausible values based on prior knowledge.

This Bayesian logistic regression model was implemented using the rstanarm package, leveraging Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for parameter estimation. Further diagnostics and posterior summaries are discussed in the supplementary materials (see Appendix @sec-model-details).


## Model Justification

Each predictor in the model represents a specific characteristic of the crime and its context, with hypothesized effects on the likelihood of violent crime. For PREMISES_TYPE, it is expected that certain locations, such as "Transit" or "Outside," may have higher odds of violent crime due to increased public interactions or a lack of controlled environments. Conversely, premises like "Educational" or "House" are anticipated to have lower odds of violent crime, reflecting their relatively private or structured settings. Locations categorized as "Other" may include mixed contexts, resulting in varying effects.

For TIME_OF_DAY, it is hypothesized that the "Evening" period may exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, as this time is often associated with increased social activities and potential for interpersonal conflict. "Early Morning" may also show elevated odds due to decreased public surveillance and fewer witnesses. In contrast, "Morning" and "Afternoon" are expected to have lower odds, reflecting typical daytime routines with higher levels of oversight and structured activity.

By incorporating these predictors into the Bayesian logistic regression model, this study seeks to identify and quantify the relationships between crime characteristics and the likelihood of violent outcomes, providing practical findings for targeted interventions.

  )


# Results {#sec-result}

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults. The findings align with our expectations, providing insights into how premises type and time of day influence the likelihood of violent crimes. To avoid multicollinearity, the model excludes one level from each categorical predictor as the reference group: "Apartment" for PREMISES_TYPE and "Early Morning" for TIME_OF_DAY. The intercept represents the estimated log-odds of violent crime occurring when all other predictors are held constant at their reference levels. In this case, the estimated log-odds of a violent crime occurring at an "Apartment" during "Early Morning" is 0.881.

The type of premises strongly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. For instance, crimes occurring in "Transit" premises are far more likely to be violent compared to the reference group. The estimated coefficient for PREMISES_TYPETransit is 2.363, indicating a substantial increase in the log-odds of violent crime in this context. On the other hand, crimes occurring in "Commercial" and "Educational" premises are less likely to be violent, with coefficients of -0.925 and -0.957, respectively. Similarly, crimes at "House" premises exhibit the lowest likelihood of violence, as reflected by a coefficient of -1.519. These results highlight that location plays a important role in determining whether a crime is violent or non-violent.

Time of day also significantly impacts the likelihood of violent crimes. Compared to the reference level of "Early Morning," the coefficients for TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon and TIME_OF_DAYEvening are 0.413 and 0.325, respectively, suggesting an elevated likelihood of violent crimes during these times. The "Morning" time of day exhibits a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, as shown by a coefficient of 0.074.

Figure 7 (see Section B.3) shows the range of coefficient estimates for our model within the 90% probability interval. However, because the credibility intervals for several predictors are relatively narrow, particularly for premises types like "Transit," it is challenging to observe the trends clearly. To address this, Figure 8 was created with the x-axis limited to a range of -5 to 5. Combining Figures 7 and 8, we observe statistical significance for several predictors, including "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," as their credibility intervals do not cross zero.

The coefficients are reported in log-odds, where a positive value indicates an increased likelihood of violent crime, and a negative value reflects a decreased likelihood. The results demonstrate clear statistical significance for important predictors such as "Transit," "Afternoon," and "Evening," emphasizing the importance of both location and time of day in shaping violent crime outcomes.


# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Relationship between Premises Type and Violent Crime

The analysis highlights that premises type significantly influences the likelihood of violent crimes. Crimes occurring in "Transit" locations are strongly associated with higher odds of being classified as violent compared to the reference group ("Apartment"). This finding aligns with expectations, as transit environments often involve high volumes of people and limited surveillance, which may increase the potential for interpersonal conflicts. Similarly, "Outside" locations exhibit a higher likelihood of violent crimes, likely due to their open and less controlled nature, which may facilitate confrontations or opportunistic violence. In contrast, premises such as "Commercial," "Educational," and "House" are associated with lower odds of violent crimes. These findings suggest that environments with greater structural or social control (e.g., schools, private residences) are less conducive to violent activities. These insights underscore the importance of targeted safety measures in high-risk locations, such as enhancing surveillance in transit areas or increasing community policing efforts in outdoor public spaces.

## Relationship between Time of Day and Violent Crime

Time of day also plays a important role in determining the likelihood of violent crimes. The model results indicate that "Afternoon" and "Evening" periods are associated with elevated odds of violent crimes compared to the reference period ("Early Morning"). This pattern likely reflects increased social interactions and activities during these times, which may lead to heightened opportunities for conflicts or criminal acts. In contrast, "Morning" hours exhibit a negligible increase in violent crime likelihood, possibly reflecting a time of day characterized by structured routines and reduced social friction. These findings highlight the need for time-sensitive interventions, such as increased police presence during evening hours or community-based programs to address the underlying causes of violent behavior during high-risk times.

## Implications for Policy and Prevention

The results provide practical findings for crime prevention and public safety policies. For example, transit and outdoor areas, identified as high-risk premises, could benefit from increased surveillance, improved lighting, and targeted community engagement programs. Similarly, allocating law enforcement resources more strategically to focus on evening and afternoon periods could help deter violent crimes during these high-risk times. The findings also support urban planning efforts that enhance safety features in public spaces, such as the installation of security cameras and the promotion of neighborhood watch programs. By addressing the specific premises and times associated with violent crimes, policymakers can implement evidence-based strategies to reduce violence and improve community safety.

Implications for Practical Applications
To translate the findings of this study into actionable tools for stakeholders, we developed a RESTful API for predicting the likelihood of violent crimes based on premises type and time of day. This API allows users, such as law enforcement agencies and urban planners, to input specific contexts and receive real-time predictions on violent crime probability.

The API, implemented using the plumber package in R [@plumber], integrates the Bayesian logistic regression model developed in this study. It provides an intuitive interface for generating insights, enabling evidence-based decision-making for resource allocation and targeted interventions. By leveraging this tool, policymakers can proactively address high-risk scenarios and improve community safety.

## Limitations

### Data Constraints

One limitation of this study is the exclusion of crimes that could not be definitively classified as violent or non-violent. While necessary to ensure data consistency, this filtering process may omit incidents that could provide additional context for understanding violent crime dynamics. Future research should explore ways to include these ambiguous cases to improve the comprehensiveness of the analysis.

### Simplification of Time Categories

Grouping time into four broad categories (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) simplifies analysis but may obscure more granular patterns in violent crime occurrence. Future research could explore finer temporal granularity, such as analyzing crimes on an hourly basis, to capture additional nuances in time-of-day effects.

## Future Steps

To enhance the utility and scope of this research, future studies should consider incorporating additional predictors, such as socioeconomic factors, neighborhood characteristics, or the presence of law enforcement resources. These variables could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions contributing to violent crimes. Additionally, integrating spatial analysis with precise location data could identify specific hotspots for targeted interventions. Policymakers and city planners could leverage these insights to allocate resources more effectively, reduce violent crimes, and promote public safety in Toronto and beyond.

# Model details {#sec-model-details}

## Posterior Predictive Check and Prior-Posterior Comparison

The posterior predictive check in @fig-post_dist provides an evaluation of how well the Bayesian logistic regression model replicates the observed data. The posterior distribution ($y_{\text{rep}}$) closely aligns with the observed data ($y$), indicating that the model provides a good fit and captures the essential patterns in the data.

In @fig-post_prior, the posterior distributions of the model parameters are compared against their priors. This visual comparison highlights how the observed data influenced the posterior estimates. For instance, predictors such as PREMISES_TYPETransit and TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon show a notable shift in their posterior distributions compared to the priors, reflecting strong evidence provided by the data. Conversely, predictors with minimal shifts suggest less data-driven evidence or smaller effects on the model outcome.

These diagnostics are crucial to ensure that the chains mix well and converge to a stable distribution, providing reliable parameter estimates.

#### Trace Plots

@fig-trace-premise and @fig-trace-time display the trace plots for the model's intercept, premises type predictors, and time of day predictors. Each plot shows the sampled parameter values across iterations for all four chains.

- **Premises Type Predictors**: As seen in @fig-trace-premise, the chains for predictors like House, Commercial, Educational, and Outside fluctuate around stable mean values, indicating good mixing and convergence.
- **Time of Day Predictors**: @fig-trace-time illustrates the trace plots for Morning, Afternoon, and Evening time categories, along with Transit Premises. The chains for these predictors also show no significant trends or drift, confirming convergence.

## 90% Credibility Interval {#sec-credibility-interval}

Figures @fig-modelresults1 and @fig-modelresults2 visualize the 90% credible intervals for the predictors in the Bayesian logistic regression model. These plots provide insights into the uncertainty surrounding the estimated coefficients for each predictor.

Figure @fig-modelresults1 displays the 90% credible intervals for all predictors without restrictions on the x-axis. This plot shows how the predictors such as PREMISES_TYPE and TIME_OF_DAY influence the likelihood of violent crimes. For example, PREMISES_TYPETransit has a high positive credible interval, indicating a significant increase in the likelihood of violent crime in transit areas. Conversely, PREMISES_TYPECommercial and PREMISES_TYPEEducational have negative credible intervals, indicating a lower likelihood of violent crimes in these premises types.

In Figure @fig-modelresults2, the x-axis has been restricted to a range of -5 to 5 to better visualize predictors with smaller intervals. This refined view helps highlight subtle but meaningful differences between categories like TIME_OF_DAYAfternoon and TIME_OF_DAYEvening, which show a noticeable increase in the likelihood of violent crimes compared to the reference category (TIME_OF_DAYEarly Morning).

The simulated dataset includes 1,000 observations with the following variables derived from the survey:

VIOLENT_CRIME: Binary outcome variable indicating whether the crime was violent (1) or not (0).
PREMISES_TYPE: Categorical predictor representing the type of premises (e.g., Apartment, House, Commercial).
TIME_OF_DAY: Categorical predictor indicating when the incident occurred (e.g., Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
ALCOHOL_INVOLVED: Binary predictor showing whether alcohol was involved (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
AREA_FAMILIARITY: Binary predictor indicating whether the respondent was familiar with the area (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
I will now proceed to fit a Bayesian logistic regression model using this simulated dataset. ​​

2/2

The new simulated dataset includes 1,000 observations with the following variables derived from the survey:

VIOLENT_CRIME: Binary outcome variable indicating whether the crime was violent (1) or not (0).
GENDER: Categorical predictor with values 'Male', 'Female', and 'Non-binary'.
ALCOHOL_INVOLVED: Binary predictor showing whether alcohol was involved in the incident (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
AREA_FAMILIARITY: Binary predictor indicating whether the respondent was familiar with the area (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
LIGHTING_CONDITIONS: Categorical predictor describing the lighting conditions at the time of the incident ('Well-lit', 'Dimly lit', 'Dark').
I will now fit a Bayesian logistic regression model using this dataset. ​​

The logistic regression model provides insights into how the simulated predictors relate to the likelihood of violent crime. Here are the main takeaways from the results:

Intercept: Indicates the baseline log-odds of violent crime when all predictors are at their reference levels.
GENDER:
Compared to the reference group (Female), neither "Male" nor "Non-binary" had a statistically significant effect on violent crime likelihood.
LIGHTING_CONDITIONS:
"Dimly lit" and "Well-lit" conditions compared to "Dark" showed no significant association with violent crime likelihood.
ALCOHOL_INVOLVED:
No statistically significant relationship was observed between alcohol involvement and the likelihood of violent crime.
AREA_FAMILIARITY:
Familiarity with the area also did not significantly influence the likelihood of violent crime.
These results suggest no strong evidence for these predictors being significant in determining violent crime likelihood within this simulation. However, the framework allows for further exploration or refinement with different variables or distributions.

If you'd like, I can create visualizations or conduct further diagnostics on this model. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! ​​





You said:
lets not use gender
ChatGPT said:
The updated logistic regression model excludes GENDER as a predictor and uses the following variables:

Predictors and Results
Intercept:
The baseline log-odds of violent crime when all predictors are at their reference levels (Dark lighting, no alcohol involvement, unfamiliar area). It is statistically significant (
p
<
0.01
p<0.01).
LIGHTING_CONDITIONS:
"Dimly lit" and "Well-lit" conditions (compared to "Dark") do not significantly affect the likelihood of violent crime.
ALCOHOL_INVOLVED:
Alcohol involvement remains non-significant in determining the likelihood of violent crime (
p
>
0.05
p>0.05).
AREA_FAMILIARITY:
Familiarity with the area does not have a statistically significant impact on violent crime likelihood.
Summary
The exclusion of GENDER does not change the overarching finding: none of the predictors (lighting conditions, alcohol involvement, or area familiarity) show a significant relationship with violent crime likelihood in this simulated dataset.

If you'd like, I can create visualizations or explore different model specifications to enhance interpretability. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! ​​

ALCOHOL_INVOLVED simulates whether alcohol was involved (30% probability).
AREA_FAMILIARITY simulates whether the area was familiar (40% probability).
LIGHTING_CONDITIONS randomly selects among 'Well-lit', 'Dimly lit', and 'Dark' with probabilities 40%, 40%, and 20%.
Model:

A Bayesian logistic regression is fitted using stan_glm from the rstanarm package.
Predictors include ALCOHOL_INVOLVED, AREA_FAMILIARITY, and LIGHTING_CONDITIONS.
Output:

The summary(model) command displays parameter estimates, standard errors, and credible intervals.
The plot(model) command visualizes the posterior distributions of the coefficients.

Here's the updated preamble for your code:

#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Simulate a dataset of crime-related survey responses, including 
# variables related to violent crime, alcohol involvement, area familiarity, 
# and lighting conditions.
# Author: Tim Chen
# Contact: timwt.chen@mail.utoronto.ca
# Date: [Insert today's date]
# License: MIT
# Pre-requisites: The `tidyverse` package must be installed.
# Outputs: A CSV file ("survey_simulated_crime_data.csv") containing 1000 rows and 4 variables:
#          - `VIOLENT_CRIME`: Binary variable indicating whether a crime was violent (1) or not (0).
#          - `ALCOHOL_INVOLVED`: Binary variable indicating whether alcohol was involved (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
#          - `AREA_FAMILIARITY`: Binary variable indicating whether the respondent was familiar with the area (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
#          - `LIGHTING_CONDITIONS`: Categorical variable describing the lighting conditions at the time of the incident 
#                                   ('Well-lit', 'Dimly lit', 'Dark').
# Notes: This script generates 1000 simulated survey responses and saves the data to a CSV file.
This preamble provides clarity on the purpose, variables, and outputs of the simulation. Let me know if there are additional details you’d like to include!

since its now saved as a file, how can i show my data simulation
ChatGPT said:
To demonstrate your data simulation, you can use both a descriptive summary and visualizations. Here's how you can show your simulated data in R:

Steps to Present the Data Simulation
View the First Few Rows: Use head() to display a sample of your simulated dataset.

# View the first few rows of the dataset
print(head(simulated_data))
Provide a Summary: Use summary() to generate a descriptive summary of all variables.

# Summary of the dataset
summary(simulated_data)
Visualize Key Variables: Create histograms and bar plots to visualize the distributions of your variables.

Example Visualizations
Proportion of Violent Crimes:

simulated_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(VIOLENT_CRIME))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    x = "Violent Crime (0 = No, 1 = Yes)",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Distribution of Violent Crimes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Lighting Conditions Distribution:

simulated_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = LIGHTING_CONDITIONS)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(
    x = "Lighting Conditions",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Lighting Conditions at Incident Time"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Proportion of Alcohol Involvement:

simulated_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(ALCOHOL_INVOLVED))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "tomato") +
  labs(
    x = "Alcohol Involved (0 = No, 1 = Yes)",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Alcohol Involvement in Incidents"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Area Familiarity:

simulated_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(AREA_FAMILIARITY))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "purple") +
  labs(
    x = "Area Familiarity (0 = No, 1 = Yes)",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Familiarity with Area"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Export to Markdown or Report: Include the first few rows and the summary statistics in a report or markdown document for presentation.

Data Management and Analysis
Data Simulation
To ensure a reproducible and structured approach to understanding survey outcomes, a simulated dataset was created based on the survey design. This simulated dataset reflects the variables identified as significant for analyzing factors influencing violent crimes in Toronto. The data includes:

VIOLENT_CRIME: Binary variable indicating whether a crime was violent (1) or not (0).

#### Data Simulation

To validate and explore the survey design, a simulated dataset was generated to reflect the variables of interest. This dataset includes:

- **VIOLENT_CRIME**: Binary variable indicating whether a crime was violent (1) or non-violent (0).
- **ALCOHOL_INVOLVED**: Binary variable indicating whether alcohol was involved in the incident (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **AREA_FAMILIARITY**: Binary variable indicating whether the victim was familiar with the area (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **LIGHTING_CONDITIONS**: Categorical variable describing the lighting conditions at the time of the incident ('Well-lit', 'Dimly lit', 'Dark').

The dataset was generated using R, saved as a CSV file, and subsequently visualized to ensure the data reflects the survey's design specifications.

Data Simulation
To validate and explore the survey design, a simulated dataset was generated to reflect the variables of interest. This dataset was developed to align with the structure of the survey and represent realistic distributions of responses. The variables in the simulated dataset include:

VIOLENT_CRIME: A binary variable indicating whether a crime was violent (1) or non-violent (0).
ALCOHOL_INVOLVED: A binary variable indicating whether alcohol was involved in the incident (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
AREA_FAMILIARITY: A binary variable indicating whether the victim was familiar with the area (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
LIGHTING_CONDITIONS: A categorical variable describing the lighting conditions at the time of the incident ('Well-lit', 'Dimly lit', 'Dark').
The simulation was implemented in R, and the dataset was saved as a CSV file (survey_simulated_crime_data.csv) in the project directory for further analysis. Visualization of the simulated data was performed to confirm alignment with survey design expectations.
